In this podcast, [Art Remillard][] speaks with [Joshua Rothman][] about
his new book *[Flush Times and Fever Dreams: A Story of Capitalism and
Slavery in the Age of Jackson][book]*. Professor Rothman is an associate
professor of history at the University of Alabama and the director of
the [Summersell Center for the Study of the South][]. During this
conversation, Rothman recounts the fascinating story of Virgil Stewart
and John Murrell, as well as the gruesome details of Mississippi’s
notorious wave of violence in the summer of 1835. He also reflects on
how his research might raise valuable questions for scholars of southern
religion.
