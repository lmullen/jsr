In this podcast, [Art Remillard][] talks with [Joseph Williams][] about
his new book, *[Spirit Cure: A History of Pentecostal Healing][]*.
Williams is an assistant professor of religion at Rutgers University. In
this discussion, he explains how the history of healing practices in
pentecostalism is marked by a variety of pragmatic exchanges with
everything from mainstream medicine to metaphysical religion. Williams
concludes with a preview of his next book project, which looks at
concepts of prophecy within pentecostalism.
