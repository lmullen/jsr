In Fall 2012, *[Perspectives in Religious Studies][]* featured six
articles that examined the complex ways that southern evangelicals
engaged with the culture of the New South. In this podcast, [Art
Remillard][] speaks with the editor of this special issue, [Joe Coker][]
of Baylor University. Coker discusses how his book, *[Liquor in the Land
of the Lost Cause][]* served as backdrop for this issue. Remillard then
interviews contributor [John Hayes][] of Georgia Regents University
about his article, "The Evangelical Ethos and the Spirit of
Capitialism." Hayes examines the role played by evangelicals in the
emergence of a market revolution in the South. He also offers a brief
glimpse into his forthcoming book on southern folk Christianity. The
podcast concludes with [Glenn Feldman][] of the University of Alabama at
Birmingham explaining his article, "Making 'The Southern Religion':
Economics, Theology, Martial Patriotism, and Social Indifference---(and
the Big Bang Theory of Modern American Politics." He emphasizes that the
"distinct" brand of southern evangelicalism born in the New South still
influences the region (and nation) today.

The remaining authors and articles in the issue are:

-   [Paul Harvey][], "'The Right-Minded Members of that Race': Southern
    Religious Progressives Confront Race, 1880-1930"
-   [Fred Arthur Bailey][], "Schooling the Negro to His Proper
    Subordination: White Protestants and Black Education in the New
    South"
-   [Kelly J. Baker][], "Evangelizing Klansmen, Nationalizing the South:
    Faith, Fraternity, and Lost Cause Religion in the 1920s Klan"

    Enthusiasts, and the Idea of Jack Johnson in the New South."
