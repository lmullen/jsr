<h2>Current Issue: Volume 18</h2>

<p>Volume 18 opens the issue year with a Forum on the southern religious life within the Atlantic World and thirteen book reviews. This year we hope to exmaine the meaning of "southern religion" beyond the narrow confines of evangelical denominationalism. While evangelicals remain a dominant group and their exploration will never be complete, <em>JSR</em> hopes to encourage scholars to look beyond the borders of the South to see how the region's religious experience both shaped a wider world and was in turn shaped by that wider world's influences. Our first Forum explores how we might think about the South and religion beyond either narrow borders or definitions. We hope that this work helps other scholars think about the region beyond the assumptions of denominationalism inherent in southern religion. We also release our first round of Book Reviews.</p>
