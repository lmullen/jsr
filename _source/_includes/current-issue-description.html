<h2>Current Issue: Volume 17</h2>

<p>With the release of Volume 17, the <em>Journal of Southern Religion</em> begins the process of rolling releases. As content becomes available, we will push book reviews, articles, and forums to the website.
The May edition of Volume 17 features an article on segregationists' hermeneutical approaches to scripture in the 1960s and an article on the J.R. Graves's newspaper accumen and the expansion of his particular form of Baptists beliefs.
Eleven book reviews of recent books in the field round out this release of Volume 17 of the <em>JSR</em>.
The June release features a Fourm on southern civil religions with five essays that expand our understanding of civil religion and its relationship to the Lost Cause. We also include six more book reviews. For the summer months of July and August, we roll out a series of essays that examines Donald G. Mathews's piece on spectacle lynchings, "The Southern Rite of Human Sacrifice," that appeared fifteen years ago in the journal. This critical conversation fulfills an important addition to <em>JSR</em>'s offerings by putting timely pieces out for conversation and reflection in the field.</p>
