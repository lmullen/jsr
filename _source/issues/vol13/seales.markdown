Euna Coone Watson agreed to join the First Baptist Church of Sanford,
North Carolina, in 1925, provided she could be the first person to try
out its new baptistery. Recalling the moment several decades later in an
interview for the church's centennial history, her nephew John Fore, Jr.
noted that his aunt Euna "was crazy over new things and wanted to be the
first person baptized in the new brick church. She would join if she was
first!" He also remembered that his uncle, the town barber, used the
promise of the indoor baptistery to convince aunt Euna, who was a
Methodist, to become a fellow member of the downtown Baptist church.
Initial designs included a "stained glass scene" and an electric heater
to warm the water. Construction was delayed two years, however, because
the stained glass company "went busted," the "electric waterheater would
not knock the chill off the water," and the "baptismal pool sprung
several leaks and had to be welded." Eventually, the church used plain
glass and plugged the holes, but on the night of the inaugural baptism,
the heater failed once again, leaving the pool "too cold for Mrs.
Watson." After a second candidate also declined, Euna's nephew John
Fore, Jr. braved the waters to become the first believer symbolically
buried with Christ and raised to walk in the newness of FBC
Sanford.[^1]

The excitement for a new indoor baptistery at FBC Sanford illustrates
how southern evangelicals embraced the material culture of industrial
progress in the early twentieth century United States, despite its
setbacks. Observers of the American South, however, tend to view the
relationship between southern religion and industrial development as
protagonist to antagonist. They often characterize evangelical
Protestantism as a socially conservative movement that resisted
modernity and contrast it with liberal Protestantism in the North as a
socially progressive movement that adapted to modernity.[^2]
Focusing on theological defenses of racial difference and opposition to
modern intellectual developments such as Biblical criticism and
Darwinian evolution, historians often overlook how southern evangelicals
vigorously celebrated technological marvels of the modern age. As Beth
Barton Schweiger notes, historians frequently portray southern churches
as "bastions of premodern and antimodern sentiment."[^3] But
Aunt Euna's love of new things and her desire to be first were anything
but antimodern sentiments. Perceiving southern religion as antagonistic
with the forces of industrialization and urbanization that transformed
the South after the Civil War, historians have struggled to make sense
of the dynamic relationship between southern Protestants and a broader
industrial America.[^4] Schweiger reminds us, though, that
religion flourished in the nineteenth century South and the rest of the
United States "for reasons far more complex than a simple distaste for
modernity and industrial capitalism." Furthermore, "Protestant belief
bloomed most furiously in the New South, creating the Bible Belt in a
place and time when the region was most deeply affected by
industrialization and urbanization."[^5]

This article uses the material history of indoor baptisteries in the
American South to blur categorical boundaries between old and new,
primitive and modern, and religious and secular by showing how seemingly
"old-time" southern Baptists embraced what they considered the modern
technology of indoor baptisteries. The hands of modernity,
industrialization and urbanization, did not swing heavily upon southern
religion.[^6] Instead, they facilitated the rebirth and
redistribution of "old" modes of enchantment in "new"
forms.[^7] In their celebration of indoor baptisteries,
Baptists in the early twentieth century professed an old love for new
things. That love was sown in Baptist "city churches" of the Old South
and continued to grow stronger in New South "city churches" like FBC
Sanford that sprung up in manufacturing towns along railroad lines
crisscrossing the southern landscape.

The article addresses five interrelated themes concerning the promotion
and construction of indoor baptisteries in the American South: the
juxtaposition of primitive baptism and the modern world, the
relationship between church authority and racial segregation, the
promotion of indoor baptisteries as architectural symbols of white
dominion over the urban landscape, the use of indoor baptisteries as a
ritual tool for regulating black bodies in southern cities, and the
persistence of those patterns from the old city churches of the
nineteenth century to the new city churches of the twentieth century.
The argument begins with a theological justification for indoor
baptisteries by nineteenth century Baptist minister Isaac Taylor Hinton.
It then shows that theology at work in material practice, detailing the
construction of an indoor baptistery at First Baptist Church Richmond,
Virginia, where Hinton had served as pastor. Comparing the case of FBC
Richmond to FBC Charleston, South Carolina, and FBC Savannah, Georgia,
we learn that city Baptists in the Old South often constructed their
indoor baptisteries before the availability of pipes and pumps and those
constructions were shaped by the history of race and slavery in the
South. Within that setting, white Baptists controlled access to the
baptistery. In churches that included both black and white members, they
baptized white converts before their black brothers and sisters. In most
cases, though, white leaders self-segregated those congregations,
limiting access to the baptistery only to whites, while encasing it in
architectural grandeur. Such patterns suggest that the construction of
baptisteries was not a passive response to the forces of
industrialization and urbanization. Rather, southern Baptists used the
baptistery with religious and racial intent and celebrated it as one of
the technological innovations that distinguished the modern church.
Patterns displayed in the Old South persisted within the racially
segregated spaces of New South Baptist churches, many of which were
located in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Virginia.[^8]

### Primitive Baptism in the Modern World ###

In *A History of Baptism: From Inspired and Uninspired Writings*, first
published in 1840, Isaac Taylor Hinton attempted exactly what the title
suggests. He compiled a history of baptism from early Christianity to
his present day, piecing together quotes and evidence from existing
works while interspersing them with brief commentary. Hinton prefaced
his endeavor by emphasizing the importance of preserving and defending
"sacred truths" at a time when "men in all professions are making
unheard-of-efforts … in pursuit of secular interests." He wrote that for
the Christian, "There is something at once strengthening and delightful
in the process of historical investigation." But not all historical
inquiries necessarily led to sacred truth for Hinton, even if they
produced undisputed evidence. In one passage, he noted the "singular and
interesting fact, that the University of Oxford (the highest Episcopal
institution, in the world) has recently printed a beautiful edition of
Wall's History of Infant Baptism, *with Gale's Reply*." While he
appreciated this historical account, he made it clear that defending the
"historic truth on the subject of baptism" was necessary because of the
doctrinal threats posed by "advocates of sprinkling" who rejected
immersion as an "apostolic mode of baptism." As a Baptist apologist,
Hinton sifted through various historical accounts of church practice,
built on them, and metered their meaning. Spurred by the writings of
those who had made a "secular bargain with God Almighty," he engaged
history in an effort to defend what he considered a foundational
doctrine of the Christian church.[^9]

In a section entitled, "Ancient Baptisteries, and Persons Baptized in
Them," Hinton recovered the primitive practice of Christian baptism,
retained its essence as immersion, and reclaimed the role of Baptists in
their use of indoor baptisteries as guardians of that apostolic practice
in the modern age. He explained how "the primitive christians were under
the necessity of baptizing either in open waters or in private baths"
because "the state of the law would not admit of their erecting public
baptisteries." After Constantine removed such prohibitions, however,
urban Christians embraced the indoor baptistery. Hinton quotes, "Mr.
Robinson":

> Baptisteries are first sought where they are first wanted, in towns
> and cities; for writers of unquestionable authority affirm that the
> primitive christians continued to baptize in rivers, pools, and baths,
> till about the middle of the third century. At this time baptisteries
> began to be built; but there were none within the churches till the
> sixth century; and it is remarkable that, though there were many
> churches in one city, yet (with a few exceptions) there was but one
> baptistery. This simple circumstance became in time a title of
> dominion, and the congregation nearest the baptistery, to whom in some
> places it belonged, and by whom it was lent to the other churches,
> pretended that all the others ought to consider themselves as
> dependent on them.

In this passage, Hinton (via Robinson) distinguished between primitive
and modern Christians based on the practice of baptism by immersion,
whether in a river, pool, or bath. Hinton positioned the baptistery in
continuity with that primitive practice, whereas he considered the
baptismal basin used by the "paedobaptists" a modern imitation. He also
explained how it could be used as a source of church authority over
neighboring congregations that lacked a baptistery but wanted access to
one. Hinton further depicted the primitive practice of baptism by
immersion as springing forth from the natural landscape and flowing over
into urban life. In an earlier passage, he remembered the rivers of
Damascus as "uniting immediately above the city, and running through it,
they afforded a full supply of water for its public and private baths."
For Hinton, the urban baptistery sanctified and celebrated "those
beauteous streams" that were "the scene of Paul's baptism." To all his
critics, he declared, "If on some occasions the stones of the street are
ready to cry out, surely Abana and Pharpar will exclaim aloud, should
their limpid streams be repudiated for the modern
basin!"[^10]

Hinton's evolutionary account of baptism, which flows from the natural
to the urban landscape, illustrates the type of nineteenth century
historical imagination that inspired a southern Baptist love for indoor
baptisteries. The baptistery contained and protected the primitive
practice of Baptism by immersion, and it connected the nineteenth or
twentieth century Baptist congregation to what they considered the true
New Testament church of early Christianity. In that way, the practice
transcended time and space and transported the believer back to the very
moment when Paul was immersed. Baptists like Hinton ladled the
baptismal river and poured it into the city church.

### Church Authority and Racial Segregation ###

To illustrate how that process worked---of preserving the primitive
practice of baptism as part of the modernizing impulse of the city
Baptist church---take the case of First Baptist Church Richmond. Hinton
initiated talks of an indoor baptistery at FBC Richmond while serving as
pastor from 1833 to 1835, though he left the congregation before
construction began. Hinton's successor, Jeremiah Bell Jeter (1802–1880),
continued those plans and oversaw the completion of the baptistery in
February 1836. In July of that year, the congregation offered the use of
the baptistery to other churches in the area.[^11] In 1837,
"the interior of the meeting-house was white-washed and painted and the
City of Richmond was persuaded to connect the house with its central
water supply, thus eliminating the necessity of buying water from a
nearby well."[^12] Demonstrating patterns later seen in the
New South, Baptists at FBC Richmond first filled the baptistery by hand
and then later used the public water system to pump water to
them.[^13]

Similar to Hinton, Jeter promoted the indoor baptistery as a modern
technological convenience, associating it with city churches and
positioning it within what he referred to as the "age of inventions." At
the end of his autobiography, Jeter proposed that, "all the elements of
nature seem to be at war with man." Fire burns "hard-earned property,"
air "may be fraught with death," and water "may overflow the lands,
wasting the products of man's toil, and leaving desolation, want, and
sickness in its track." Over the course of his many years, Jeter endured
his share of natural calamities, what he referred to as the "dark side
of human life," surviving cholera, treacherous river crossings, and
torrential rain and flooding at camp meetings. Having struggled with the
unpredictable elements, Jeter welcomed the industrial innovations of
steamboats and locomotives. Recalling a time when travelers braved the
mud and hills with horse and buggy, he dismissed complaints from
railroad car passengers about slow travel. Jeter marveled at "how many
centuries of thought and toil were needed to bring these common
conveniences (golden pens, furniture, matches, the telegraph,
phonographs, electric lights…) to their present
perfection!"[^14]

Jeter counted indoor baptisteries among those common conveniences. He
considered them one of the many architectural improvements made
available to rural Baptist churches. Jeter recalled that in his boyhood
he never knew "a single neat and comfortable house of worship." Few, if
any, of those log churches had steeples, organs, or even adequate
seating. Many had cracks so big "a stout dog might have passed through."
Their pews were "narrow, low benches, without backs." Lacking windows or
stoves, curtains or cushions, Jeter considered these "meeting-houses"
unfit to stable horses and mules. In contrast, he described "city
churches," those built of wood or brick in the mid-nineteenth century,
as "spacious, convenient, and comfortable." Although he was uncertain
whether the "social and moral influence" of all "useful inventions"
would be for "good or for evil," Jeter promoted the use of indoor
baptisteries as one of the "changes for the better" in the churches he
served. For the southern Baptist minister, the still waters inside the
house of the Lord were much preferred to the unpredictable currents of
the countryside streams.[^15]

Both Hinton and Jeter celebrated the indoor baptistery as a modern
convenience without reference to racial qualifications for baptismal
candidates. When talks of the baptistery began and when construction of
the baptistery was completed, FBC Richmond included both black and white
members. Based on their writings and church minutes, there was no
indication that black members were excluded from baptism in the same
indoor pool as whites. But racial tension pervaded the church body.
Disagreements between Hinton and the congregation over racial issues led
to his resignation.[^16]Jeter faced similar struggles,
ultimately determining to resolve the conflict by segregating the
membership.

In October 1838, he initiated plans to construct another building for
white congregants. According to local church history, Jeter had "studied
the problems of his large, bi-racial membership. Convinced that neither
group in the church would achieve its maximum effectiveness under
existing conditions, he sought the wisest way to bring about a separate
house of worship and church organization for the colored Baptists in
Richmond." In Jeter's plan, black members remained in the former church
and white members constructed a new building. In March 1839, the church
held a meeting to discuss the new construction. According to church
historian Blanche White, several members opposed the plan. Two days
later the "male members of the church" called another meeting and "the
sisters and the colored members were not asked to
participate."[^17] Excluding opposing views, the white male
leadership approved the building plan without a recorded complaint.
Whether intentional or not, they also segregated the baptistery in the
process.[^18]

The indoor baptistery was the architectural centerpiece of the church
for white congregants. Designed by Thomas U. Walter, the architect who
would later oversee the construction of the capitol building in
Washington D.C., the building was completed in 1839, dedicated in
October 1841, and financed in part by selling and renting pews. A
towering steeple, "glistening white" ceilings, pew cushions of a "lovely
blue," a "wide white desk" of a pulpit, a cushioned Bible rest, and
"massive Doric pillars" distinguished the new sanctuary from the
congregation's prior home. The baptistery was placed in a recess that
"extended back of these columns, the wall of which was ornamented with a
large square of blue quilted damask, with a bright star in the center."
And "when the floor of the platform was moved, the baptismal service was
in full view of the congregation, both on the main floor and in the
galleries." The elaborate architectural displays that surrounded the
indoor baptistery set FBC Richmond apart as a white-only city church.
Again, according to the church history:

> The erection of this building led to the separation of the white and
> colored members and the organization of the First African Baptist
> Church, which continued to occupy the old structure, and which was set
> apart under the pastoral supervision of Rev. Dr. Ryland, then
> President of Richmond College. Seventeen hundred and eight colored
> members remained in the old house, while three hundred and
> eighty-seven white members removed to the new. During the first year a
> precious revival, in which the Pastor was aided by Rev. Mr. Robards of
> New York, added one hundred and sixty-seven by baptism to the Church
> in its new home.

Black members outnumbered white members more than four to one in the old
church. Without its black members, the new white-only congregation was
significantly smaller in size, though revival efforts did add several
members.[^20]

It is important to note that FBC Richmond self-segregated its membership
during a period when rural white churches forcibly integrated blacks
into their congregations. Racially segregated churches were not the norm
in the Old South. From the 1830s until the end of the Civil War, it was
common for whites and blacks to worship together. Following the plot led
by Denmark Vesey and the uprising led by Nat Turner, southern whites
worried that separate religious gatherings provided a space for slaves
to communicate and organize uprisings.[^21] In an effort to
quell this fear, slave owners required blacks to attend services in
white congregations and sit in segregated seating within their
sight.[^22] In those instances, southern whites used the
spatial arrangements of their churches to maintain racial difference in
the midst of religious inclusion.

The precise sequence of events displayed at FBC Richmond---forced
integration, indoor baptistery construction, and self-segregation---was
anomalous, though the racial tensions were typical for that time period.
Comparable city Baptist congregations, such as First Baptist Church and
Alfred Street Baptist Church in Alexandria, Virginia, often
self-segregated before they built their baptisteries. Both
congregations, the former historically white and the latter historically
black, developed out of the Alexandria Baptist Society, founded in 1803.
According to Alton S. Wallace, the church historian of Alfred Street
Baptist, black Baptist experience with "in-door pools" came after the
(white) Alexandria Baptist Society and the Colored Baptist Society
divided into separate congregations. The black congregation maintained
independent church meetings through the 1830s, though under the more
watchful eye of white authorities. Following the prohibition of black
gatherings in Alexandria in 1831, the "Rev. William Evans of Colored
Baptist Society and 45 others" signed a petition from the free Negroes
to the Mayor "asserting that Negroes in Alexandria will not revolt
against whites, as did Nat Turner." The Colored Baptist Society
continued to meet at Alfred Street under the supervision of the
Alexandria Baptist Society. In 1842, they purchased their building site
at Alfred Street, which they had leased for eighteen years. In 1850, the
Colored Baptist Society was "granted complete independence from \[the\]
conjoined Alexandria Baptist Society, which now called itself the
Alexandria Baptist Church."[^23]

The case of FBC Richmond, compared with that of FBC Alexandria, suggests
that Baptists used indoor baptisteries to exercise church authority over
sacred space, bounding the primitive practice of baptism within the
modern world. In the nineteenth century, white Baptists in the American
South racialized that authority, using the indoor baptistery for more
than just a material marker of theological distinction. White Baptists
distinguished their segregated church buildings by displaying the first
indoor baptistery in town or a baptistery more elaborate in
architectural grandeur than that of their black Baptist
neighbors.[^24]The designation "first" signified white racial
status in southern cities. White Baptists in both the Old and New South
staked claim to "First Baptist" as their own, thus making it necessary
for black Baptists to refer to their congregations as the First African
or First Colored Baptist Church, while making any equivalent reference
to whiteness, such as the First Anglo Baptist Church, merely redundant.
In this seemingly banal nomenclature, southern whites asserted
themselves as the original, real, or true Baptist church in the given
municipality.[^25]

### The White City ###

The type of authority exercised by white Baptists in the construction of
indoor baptisteries was directly connected to their projection of the
church building as a symbol of public power over the nineteenth century
urban landscape. The construction of downtown churches went hand in hand
with the public presentation of southern towns as white controlled
civilized cities, and the indoor baptistery distinguished the typical
First Baptist Church among other First Church brands. Take Savannah,
Georgia. In its early years, Savannah was known as a "sickly hole in the
woods." As part of its planning efforts to civilize that sickly hole,
the City of Savannah passed an ordinance in 1790 that granted lots for
Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Lutherans, Baptists, and Jews to build
downtown houses of worship. In 1791, the Baptist Society received a lot
on Washington Square. In 1791, they exchanged that lot for another on
Franklin Square. And in 1794, they began plans for building a church
structure, despite the fact that as Baptist historian George Shriver
notes, "there was really no formally organized and chartered church of
individuals and pastor." Rather than a local church body of Baptist
believers expressing a need to build a place of worship, a conglomerate
of key business, civic, and religious leaders in Savannah and beyond
provided the impetus for constructing a downtown Baptist church.
According to Shriver, "Jonathan Clarke, George Mosse, Thomas Polhill,
and David Adams took the lead in this project and were encouraged by the
Revered Mr. Reese, a Baptist minister from Wales who happened to be
visiting the city. Contributions toward this end came from interested
Baptists in South Carolina, interested citizens of Savannah, and from
denominational bodies in the city."[^26] Many of those
leaders were wealthy landowners and manufacturers. George Mosse, for
example, was a medical doctor from Dublin, Ireland, who immigrated to
South Carolina and "became the owner of a large amount of landed
property, was a prominent planter, and a leading manufacturer of
leather." He continued to practice medicine and later left the
Protestant Episcopal Church to join "the Baptist faith."[^27]

Under the leadership of an elite group of white planners, Baptists built
a church structure in downtown Savannah in 1795. In his account of the
church minutes, Shriver described the structure as a "frame building
some fifty by sixty feet" with a steeple. There was no mention of a
baptistery. The church building survived a fire in 1796 and was leased
to Presbyterians "without a home" until 1800. By 1829, the church had
131 members and in April of that year, the city deeded another location
for a new building. In 1831, construction on a "new Baptist Church" for
white members began and the former lots and church building were sold to
the First African Baptist Church. White Baptists used the money raised
from that sale to help fund the construction of their new
building.[^28]

The urban planning of a "First Baptist Church" Savannah was an attempt
by southern whites to control public space and black bodies. Even after
selling the older building to First African Baptist, white Baptists in
Savannah struggled to maintain their authority over the worship
practices of black Baptists in that former space. Andrew Marshall, who
succeeded Andrew Bryan as pastor of First African Church, preached the
necessity of baptism for salvation, a theological view popularized by
Alexander Campbell and considered heretical by white Baptists in
Savannah. Shriver describes the controversy by stating:

> The fact that the black church was using the former white church
> building for 'heretical' purposes poured more salt into the wound of
> relationships. By January 1833, the black church on the surface agreed
> to place itself under the watchful eye of the white church but set
> down a series of conditions which actually preserved its own
> fundamental autonomy, a key Baptist congregational belief. Offended,
> in August the white church tried to exert pressure by writing a letter
> to William T. Williams, mayor of Savannah, which was crystal clear in
> intent: 'The individuals composing the First African Church are in
> part the property of our citizens, and it is for them, if they feel
> any interest in their everlasting or temporal welfare, to interpose
> and save them from the baneful influence of a designing man.'

Despite the fact that black Baptists in Savannah organized themselves
into a church body before their white brethren, and that black ministers
converted at least one of the leaders of the white congregation, the
"citizens" of Savannah still considered the "individuals composing the
First African Church" as mere "property." [^29] As such, they
were subject to the similar authority and control exhibited by white
Baptists on other types of property, such as their baptisteries and
their buildings.

### Regulating Black Bodies

In "The Relation of the White and Colored Baptists," a speech delivered
at the "Great Centennial of the Colored Baptists of Georgia" in Savannah
in 1888, the Reverend T. J. Hornsby of Augusta, Georgia, described the
experiences of blacks within white churches in the Old South. He began
by explaining that:

> In most of the white churches there was a colored element attached,
> who had sought the same Saviour under trying circumstances. They came
> with fear and trembling and related their experience, and if it met
> the approbation of their owners, who sometimes were Baptists and
> sometimes strangers to my God, they were given a pass and allowed to
> unite with the church, and thank God, sometimes indorsing him or her
> as a good, obedient "nigger." Before the church they professed Christ;
> in the sight of the people they were buried in baptism, which made us
> brethren, and the white Baptists knew it, and they also knew that we
> as a mass didn't know it. So the time of our ignorance God may have
> winked at, but it left us brethren still, and sons of the same God.

In Reverend Hornsby's description, it is clear that the rituals of
racial difference contradicted the professed spiritual equality of
believer's baptism in white controlled churches. Describing the
"individual treatment of \[Christian\] fraternity," the minister
remembered "the negro Baptists were quite as kind and polite as the
white brother, for in the week the white Baptists called him Pete, Hamp
and Bill, but sometimes on Sunday they would say Peter, Hampton and
William, while this negro Baptist, in his presence, would invariably use
the same title, 'Master,' (behind his back something else, of course).
Neither was perfect." Hornsby then describes how white Baptists
exercised their control over black bodies within the very same ritual of
baptism. Where the colored people existed, their converts were baptized
by the pastor in charge, who was (of course) the white Baptist. When he
had gotten through dipping the white converts, in walked the colored
proselyte and was buried in the same water; yea, sometimes in the same
spot. By regulating when black converts were allowed in the baptismal
waters and stipulating the conditions of their baptism, white Baptists
worked to maintain spatial distinctions between racialized bodies, even
if the ritual space in which both candidates were baptized was "in the
same spot." [^30]

In addition to baptism, black Baptists participated in other shared
rituals latent with democratic portent, though the exercise of white
authority again bridled spiritual equality and redirected it as bodily
difference. Reverend Hornsby also noted that Black Baptists "worshipped
in the same church edifice \[as white Baptists\]," yet they occupied "the
seats in the rear." He continued to describe how "they sang the same
songs the white Baptist sung, listened to the same sermon," yet "the
brother in color" took communion "after the white Baptist had been
served with bread and wine." Sounding a note of somber solace, Hornsby
quipped, "Though a little late, it was the same supper prayed over by
the same pastor."[^31]

<ul class="thumbnails"> <li class="span6"> <div class="thumbnail">
<img src="FBCSavannah.png" /> <p>Renovation of First Baptist Church
Savannah Georgia in 1921 included a baptistery in "simple Greek Temple
form." Photo of baptistery from George H. Shriver, *Pilgrims through the
Years: A Bicentennial History of First Baptist Church, Savannah,

Hornsby's sermon details how southern whites used both ritual order and
spatial arrangements in their churches to maintain racial difference and
display class status. In Savannah, white Baptists sold their old church
building to their black brethren, yet still tried to maintain control
over it. At the same time, they displayed themselves as the "First
Church" and distinguished their new building from their former residence
by continually updating their new church building with technological and
architectural improvements. According to Shriver, the "original design
for the church consisted of Savannah's gray brick walls covered with
stucco, a recessed portico, and a cupola. Iron fencing was added in
front of the church to prevent stray animals from gaining access." In
1904, the congregation began saving to "remove the iron fence in front
of the building, to pour a concrete pavement completely around the
building, to hang electric lamps in the front of the church, to paint
the exterior, and to tend to other repairs in relation to the total
beautification." The church building underwent a major renovation in
1921, redesigned in "simple Greek temple form" to include "a new
chancel," consisting of "pulpit, baptistery, organ, and choir loft,
which were placed in front of the sanctuary." Roman shaft columns and
tall arched windows were added. Mr. Kleinsteuber's Cut Art Stone Company
of Savannah carved the columns and Mr. Ernest M. Skinner built the
"superb Skinner organ … valued at $25,200." New light fixtures were
installed, including "hanging lamps" and "smaller side wall lights."
Wooden capitals were added atop the "lofty pilasters" between the tall
windows, hand carved by "world-famous wood carvers of the Black Forest
district of Germany." Describing the renovated building, pastor Norman
W. Cox declared that, "We now have what is pronounced by many competent
critics, the most beautiful church auditorium in America. One of our
friends of discernment recently said of it: 'Its exterior is a dream in
stone, and its interior a sublime poem in its chaste
simplicity.'"[^32] With these building improvements, white
Baptists in Savannah publically displayed their presence in the city,
their social status, and their church authority.

In Charleston, like in Savannah and Richmond, observers celebrated the
architectural design of the city's First Baptist Church. In the
"Statistics of South Carolina" published in 1824, architect Robert Mills
declared that, "The Baptist Church of Charleston exhibits the best
specimen of correct taste in architecture of the modern buildings in the
city. It is purely Greek in style, simply grand in its proportions and
beautiful in its detail." Mills continued to describe the length and
breadth of the structure, its "massive colums of the highest proportions
of Doric," its "requisite apertures for windows and doors," and its
"full cornice." He also detailed the spatial order of the building,
writing:

> You enter the vestibule by three doors, on each of which the gallery
> stairs ascend; by three opposite doors you pass into the aisles
> dividing the pews into blocs: at the extreme end of the nave of the
> church are the baptismal font and the pulpit, lighted by a large
> vaulted window; around three sides of the nave, a double colonnade
> extends, rises up to the roof and supports the galleries. The lower
> order of columns is Doric, the upper Ionic, each with their regular
> entablatures.

Mills concluded by proclaiming that "The whole finished in a rich,
chaste style, and producing from the unity of the design a very pleasing
effect." As in other city Baptist churches of the Old South, the
baptismal at FBC Charleston, "lighted by a large vaulted window," stood
at the symbolic center of those material displays of what was considered
chaste simplicity.[^33]

Unlike at FBC Richmond or Savannah, however, white members of FBC
Charleston did not self-segregate until several years after constructing
a baptistery. Church records show both white and black members during
the period after the congregation moved into its new church building in
1821, which included the baptistery described above. The rolls list 280
whites and 1,117 blacks in 1837, and 288 whites and 1,143 blacks in
1840. According to historians Robert Baker and Paul Craven, church
members in 1853 expressed a concern that "not enough was being done for
the colored members." Dr. M. T. Mendenhall, who practiced medicine and
whose family owned a mill, chaired a committee in charge of finding "a
suitable place of worship for the colored people of this church, with a
pastor suiting his discourses to their understanding." The newly
segregated black members remained under the control of the white church
until they organized as the Morris Street Baptist Church in May 1865;
they later requested and received all black members listed on the rolls
of FBC Charleston.[^34]

Prior to the end of the Civil War, white leaders at FBC Charleston
organized black members in separate "divisions" based on E. T Winkler's
*Notes and Questions for the Oral Instructions of Colored People*,
published in 1857. Baker and Craven describe this structure:

> Each division had a black leader or "overseer." These men, or women,
> as was sometimes the case, were devout persons deeply committed to the
> well-being of their people. They worked faithfully at the tasks of
> instruction and nurture. They gave detailed reports on the general
> welfare of those under their care and often prescribed discipline for
> those who committed moral wrongs (such as adultery charges).

Though black leaders were commissioned with the task of pastoral care,
they reported to oversight committees, who then reported to the white
governing body of the church. White members limited their authority on
issues deemed morally significant. In one case, the "committee on
coloreds" disagreed about a decision regarding a request by George
Heyward, a slave, to remarry after his wife had been sold to another
owner outside of Charleston. They referred the matter to the church,
which then denied the request. Situated within this context of church
authority and organizational oversight, the material expressions of
"chaste simplicity" at FBC Charleston suggest that the religious
yearning of white Baptists to regulate church space and keep it
architecturally pure and aesthetically tasteful was inseparable from
their racial desire to control black bodies.[^35]

### New City Baptists ###

Patterns evident among city Baptists in the nineteenth century persisted
into the twentieth century, despite significant historical differences
between the two periods. Within the racially reconfigured Jim Crow
South, white Baptists continued to use indoor baptisteries and their
surrounding architectural designs to display church authority, to
distinguish their congregations as modern churches, and to regulate
sacred space. In the early twentieth century, downtown "First Churches"
were material markers of new urban culture in southern manufacturing
towns. The development of mill towns in central North Carolina, one of
the faster growing areas of the South during that period, illustrates
how industrialization facilitated the rebirth of urban styles displayed
in nineteenth-century city Baptist churches and made them available to
an expanding consumer class. The pattern displayed at FBC Siler City,
roughly 24 miles northwest of the town of Sanford referenced in the
opening, was typical of city Baptist churches in the New South. FBC
Siler City is an organizational descendent of Rocky River Baptist and
Loves Creek Baptist, the two oldest Baptist churches in the area, dating
back to 1756. Although all three churches remained members of the Sandy
Creek Baptist Association, there was a noticeable difference between FBC
and the other two churches. Rural churches were named after bodies of
water---Rocky *River*, Loves *Creek*. In contrast, titles of city churches
did not reference natural markers, whether rivers, creeks, rocks, shady
groves, or brush arbors. Instead, they designated the congregations as
the first, second, or even the third church of its kind within the
incorporated city limits, as was the case with *First* Baptist Church
Siler City. When those options were exhausted, Baptists often named city
churches after their streets or avenues of residence, such as Grace
Street Church in Richmond or Travis Avenue Baptist Church in Fort Worth,
Texas.[^36]

In the nineteenth century, Baptist churches in the Siler City area were
not only located near moving water; they were at times divided by it. In
the early 1800s, members of Rocky River Baptist Church who lived on the
other side of the river often had trouble making it to church during
heavy rains. Growing weary of their springtime struggles to cross high
water, they asked to be released from their membership in order to start
a new church.[^37] In 1825, they organized Loves
Creek Baptist Church. Baptists seldom needed an excuse to split
churches, parting company over any multitude of disagreements. But at
least in this case, the natural landscape played a role in the creation
of a new Baptist church. The arrival of the railroad, though, brought
another dividing line, creating an urban pocket in rural Chatham County.
In the newly incorporated Siler City, the members of the FBC were the
first white Baptists to take residence inside the city
limits.[^38]

Although a branch of Loves Creek Baptist, FBC Siler City quickly
distinguished its meetinghouse as a city church through its
architectural design, including a steeple and an indoor baptistery. It
constructed its first indoor baptistery in 1907, over a decade before
the public water system was completed in 1925. It also preceded the
availability of public electricity, which did not come on line until
1913. Among the three Baptist congregations, FBC was the first to make
such improvements. Rocky River Baptist did not add a steeple and
baptistery until 1956, when it expanded its building. Despite the
architectural innovations, the earliest FBC church structure still
resembled its rural Baptist "sister churches." In 1928, however, FBC
Siler hired Greensboro architect Harry Barton to design its second
church home.[^39]According to local historians, the church
was "easily the most ambitious in Chatham County." Replicating his
previous design used in 1924 for the First Methodist Church of Asheboro,
North Carolina, Barton "chose a heavy Romanesque style made popular by
architect Henry Hobson Richardson before the turn of the
century."[^40] When construction was completed in 1930, the
church boasted a new M. F. Moeller pipe organ from Hagerstown, Maryland
(a gift of the Woman's Missionary Society and the Ladies Aid Society),
auditorium lights (a gift of Dr. W. C. Thomas), and an elevated
baptistery with a hand-painted mural in the background.[^41]
Such displays signaled that Baptists in Siler City had come a long way
from their rural church homes.

As in Siler, FBC Sanford built its baptistery soon after it was
incorporated within the city limits. Before moving to its new brick
building in 1925, FBC Sanford met in a small frame structure,
constructed of native pine in 1896. John P. Fore, Jr., who spent time in
the old church as a child, remembered the smell of pine and the slatted
pew backs and bottoms "that would pinch your backside." Despite its
rustic qualities, the first Baptist building inside the Sanford city
limits also had a baptistery, though it was hidden behind the pulpit
underneath a door "that went down to the ground." John recalled that a
"stopper" kept the baptistery full and could be pulled to let water run
through "a little pipe" and "out beside the church."[^42]

In Gastonia, another mill town and site of Liston Pope's classic study,
*Millhands and Preachers*, the earliest building of the First Baptist
Church, built in 1885, "was a simple rectangular structure without
tower, steeple, or baptismal facilities." But in 1900, the congregation
remodeled the church, adding balconies, a new wing for Sunday school
rooms, a tower, a steeple, and a baptistery behind the
pulpit."[^43] The sesquicentennial history of Beulah Baptist
Association of North Carolina, which is comprised of mostly small rural
congregations, only includes information on baptisteries for three of
its thirty-five member churches. Of those congregations, Roxboro Baptist
Church, a city church located on Main Street in Roxboro, was the first
to use a baptistery in 1898, "eliminating the need to baptize in Turtle
Creek." The two rural churches followed. Baynes Baptist constructed a
small church in 1913 with a baptistery under the pulpit and filled it
with water with a "drain pipe from the roof," while Antioch Baptist
Church did not add a baptistery until 1982, when it renovated its
sanctuary.[^44]

City Baptist churches were more likely to construct an indoor baptistery
before their rural predecessors. But it is important to note that rural
churches may have shared a desire to modernize their congregations, but
often were hindered by a lack of resources. Baynes Baptist, for example,
developed its own technology for draining water from the roof to fill
its baptistery in the early twentieth century. But unlike in city
churches, the church history does not record any updates to that
technology with pipes, pumps, or electricity in the 1920s. Those
improvements came later to rural areas. It is significant, then, that
rural churches like Rocky River and Antioch Baptist constructed their
indoor baptisteries as part of renovations in the 1950s or later. This
suggests that rural congregations benefited from the post-WWII boom and
could afford such renovations. A desire to modernize did not necessarily
distinguish urban from rural congregations. Rather, city churches had
both the desire and the resources to renovate their buildings, make
technological updates, and distinguish themselves as modern.

A letter from Frank H. Morse of Maplewood, Missouri to *Popular
Mechanics* in 1911 illustrates the desire of some Baptists to modernize
their churches. Included in the "Shop Notes" section, Morse's letter
describes how the Baptist church in Maplewood developed its own system
to heat the baptismal water using a furnace instead of an electric water
heater. Morse wrote that, "There were no arrangements made for heating
water in the baptistery of our church, so the following plan was tried
out and worked just as efficiently as a high-priced plant." Referencing
a "Diagram of Connections," he explains how the system worked:

> A water coil heater, E, was made of pipe and fittings and connected to
> the water-main pipe A and the pipe for emptying the baptistery B, by
> two pieces of hose, C and D. After the fire in the furnace burned the
> coals, the heater E was put in through the door as shown. The water
> was allowed to run slowly from the main A and through the coil.
> Starting this heating device early in the day, the baptistery would be
> full of warm water for the evening service.

<ul class="thumbnails"> <li class="span6"> <div class="thumbnail"> <img
src="Seales_clip_image002.jpg" /> </div> </li> </ul>


Morse's letter to *Popular Mechanics* suggests that some churches could
not afford the technological conveniences associated with modern
baptisteries installed by larger city churches. Yet these churches often
developed their own homemade technologies to modernize their
congregations. At least in this case, that technology was lauded as just
as efficient as the "high-priced" options.[^45]

Often elevated behind the choir loft, on a higher plane than the pulpit,
the baptistery was the architectural centerpiece of city Baptist
churches in the New South. Not only was the baptistery surrounded by
domestic improvements, it was housed in churches constructed in Gothic
or Romanesque architectural styles, as was the case at First Baptist
Church Siler City. Industrial development accelerated the reproduction
and distribution of nineteenth century urban architectural design,
making those styles more accessible to southern
Protestants.[^46] As noted earlier, the design of
FBC Siler City was based on that of First Methodist Church of Asheboro.
Like its neighbor, FBC Sanford also had a "twin church." Its building
was identical to First Baptist Church Winchester,
Virginia.[^47]For Baptists in Siler City and Sanford, city
church styles included organ pipes, pews, stained glass, magnificent
steeples, high arches, and chandeliers. In those types of Old World
architectural expressions, southern Baptists positioned their city
churches within the historical development of Western Civilization,
using their technological improvements to show that they had embraced
the modern era and that they too marched forward in the path of
industrial progress. In doing so, they participated in a broader
cultural trend of using architecture and technology to display modern
America as the pinnacle of Christian civilization. But by moving the
primitive practice of immersion baptism inside their city churches,
Baptists distinguished themselves from the rest of Christendom,
displacing Roman Catholics and other so-called paedobaptists, including
those Protestants stained by liberalism, and claimed what they
considered their rightful role as protectors of Christian
truth.[^48]

### Conclusion ###	

Demonstrating continuity of practice among city Baptists in the Old and
New South, this essay has methodological implications for how historians
understand the relationship between religion and modernity in industrial
America. Assumptions buried deep within secularization theory continue
to shape our understanding of that relationship, despite continued
attempts to revise those approaches. As historians of religion in the
South, we distance ourselves from the theoretical frames of
secularization theory. Yet, we replicate its narrative arch when we
argue that the story of the American nation was divided between southern
history and northern history as marked by Civil War, when we claim
southerners were closer to nature and northerners were more detached
from nature, when we distinguish northern society by its more evolved
division of labor, when we identify industrialization as the vehicle of
northern conquest during the war and its expansion after the war, and
when we assume industrialization was antagonistic to southern religion
because it carried with it the secular world of the North. Various
configurations of those plot lines build on foundational assumptions
that religion evolves from the simple to the complex, history is divided
between the primitive and the modern, primitives are closer to nature,
moderns are detached from nature, modern society is distinguished by its
highly evolved division of labor, industrialization is the vehicle of
modernity, and industrialization is inimical to primitive religion (that
is, primitive religion must adapt or change in some way in order to
survive the modern world).[^49]

The development of indoor baptisteries in the American South does not
fit those grand narratives. If the classical paradigm of secularization
theory and the standard story of southern religion held true, then the
industrial arrival of pipes and pumps should have precipitated the
religious innovation of indoor baptisteries, which would have appeared
first in northern manufacturing cities and then later in southern
factory towns. But that was not the case. Baptisteries first appeared in
nineteenth-century city Baptist churches and often were constructed
before the availability of public water systems. They were built around
the same time in the South as they were in the North, and they became a
standard feature of new city Baptist churches in the early twentieth
century.

Baptist desire to modernize congregations was pervasive, though the
material resources needed for that task were limited. In the Old South,
white Baptists in urban areas were more likely to posses the wealth,
labor, time, and building supplies needed to construct indoor
baptisteries. Those Baptists promoted indoor baptisteries as a modern
technological convenience and an architectural symbol of Christian
civilization. Their ability to afford a baptistery and control its
access testified to their church authority and public power. In the New
South, the rise of mass-production and the expansion of the railroad
made those types of religious displays more affordable and accessible to
an expanding consumer class. Baptist congregations in manufacturing
towns constructed indoor baptisteries before their rural predecessors
and used the modern improvement to distinguish their church building as
a distinctive presence in a racially segregated downtown landscape.
Rural churches later constructed indoor baptisteries as they were able,
suggesting they were more than willing to modernize, but waited until
they could afford to do so.

In their promotion and construction of indoor baptisteries, Baptists
bounded the primitive within the modern. As long as they continued to
practice what they considered the primitive Christian rite of baptism by
immersion, Baptists could maintain their distinguishing essence while
perpetually modernizing their congregations. And modernize they did,
surrounding the baptistery with elaborate architectural displays,
warming its waters with electric heaters, and framing it with stained
glass. Those displays, though, were fraught with symbolic import. The
ritual production of Baptist modernity in the American South was
inextricably linked to its contextual construction of racial difference.
In churches where black and white Baptists were, in the words of
Reverend Hornsby, "buried in the same water; yea, sometimes in the same
spot," white leaders distinguished a racial class of "primitive"
Christians by forcing their black brothers and sisters in Christ to be
baptised after them. As they continued to modernize their congregations,
white Baptists segregated their church space, including the baptismal
pool. They used the indoor baptistery to theologically retain primitive
baptism in the modern church, while physically removing the perceived
racial primitive from their midst. In both cases, white Baptists
projected and protected primitive difference, working to regulate and
control that difference. From the old to the new, the idea of primitive
baptism was the heart of the modern Baptist.

[^2]: William Hutchison termed what he called a "cluster of liberal
ideas" in American Protestantism as "Protestant modernism." He noted
three uses of the term "modernism" in the early twentieth century:
adaptation (an "intended adaption of religious ideas to modern
culture"), cultural immanentism (the theological idea that "God is
immanent in human cultural development and revealed through it") and
religiously–based progressivism ("human society is moving toward
realization of the Kingdom of God"). Hutchison argued that the first
view pervaded popular media and the second two views represented
theological differences among liberal Protestants. He further
distinguished between "conservative evangelicals" and "evangelical
liberals." Hutchison's typology, used to categorize Protestantism in
terms of its various theological expressions, illustrates how historians
often view the relationship between religious beliefs and secular
culture as the key criterion for distinguishing liberals from
conservatives, and moderns from fundamentalists. That interpretation has
pervaded the general historiography of American religions, most clearly
evident in citations of the Social Gospel movement as evidence of what
Hutchison referred to as "applied" liberalism. William R. Hutchison,
*The Modernist Impulse in American Protestantism* (Durham, N.C.: Duke
University Press, 1992), 2, 13, 146, 269. Tied into this framework,
foundational narratives of southern religion, particularly those that
operate on the culturally captivity thesis, reference the Social Gospel
as a placeholder of liberal Protestantism. They argue that the absence
of a Social Gospel in the American South is one of the distinctive
qualities of its regional religious expressions and they classify
southern evangelicalism as one type of otherworldly Protestantism that
has been unable to change or challenge social order. Samuel S. Hill,
*Southern Churches in Crisis Revisited* (Tuscaloosa: University of
Alabama Press, 1999). John Lee Eighmy, *Churches in Cultural Captivity:
A History of the Social Attitudes of Southern Baptists* (Knoxville:
University of Tennessee Press, 1987). In the last few decades, several
scholars have given greater attention to the presence of the Social
Gospel movement as well as the economic dimensions of evangelical
Protestantism in the American South. Some scholars have cited the
presence of the Social Gospel as a call to revise the cultural captivity
thesis. John McDowell, for example, has shown that Methodist women in
southern cities like Nashville read northern liberal Protestants like
Walter Rauschenbusch and Josiah Strong. John Patrick McDowell, *The
Social Gospel in the South: The Woman's Home Mission Movement in the
Methodist Episcopal Church, South, 1886–1939* (Baton Rouge: Louisiana
State University Press, 1982). Ultimately, though, these readings do not
sufficiently challenge dichotomies of modern or primitive, or religious
or secular that have been used to define liberal Protestantism and its
southern contrarian, conservative evangelicalism. These readings make it
difficult to discern how southern Protestants were both primitive and
modern, regionally rooted and nationally projecting, industrial and
religious, *at the same time*. If northerners used the image of the
South as a backwoods cesspool of religious fundamentalists for their own
interests, then southerners used the northern tool of economic conquest,
the factory, for their own desires. In this way, white southern
Protestants employed industrial technology to move up economically,
while maintaining in the antebellum South and later resurrecting in the
Jim Crow South the religious and regional primitivism of a divinely
sanctioned racial order. Using the so-called secular tools of modern
industry to resurrect racial order after the Civil War and
institutionalize it, along with other moral causes such as Prohibition,
southern evangelicals were agents of their own cultural captivity. The
detailed role of southern evangelicals in the institutional construction
of cultural constraint, a process Michel Foucault referred to as
"governmentality," extends well beyond the scope of this article, though
its basic mechanics are demonstrated in Baptist use of indoor
baptisteries. On northern media images of the South, see Mary Beth
Swetnam Mathews, *Rethinking Zion: How the Print Media Placed
Fundamentalism in the South* (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press,
2006). On the pastoral promotion of progress in the nineteenth century
American South, see Beth Barton Schweiger, *The Gospel Working Up:

[^4]:  Historians often cite antebellum religious habits as a
defining characteristic of southern identity, diligently demonstrating
connections between white evangelical Protestantism and the peculiar
institution, noting a historical movement away from radical abolitionism
to institutional concession. Donald G. Mathews, *Religion in the Old
South* (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1977). Mitchell Snay,
*Gospel of Disunion: Religion and Separatism in the Antebellum South*

*Freedom's Coming: Religion Culture and the Shaping of the South from
the Civil War through the Civil Rights Era* (Chapel Hill: University of
North Carolina Press, 2005). Focusing solely on regional
distinctiveness, however, makes it difficult for historians to observe
the industrial and economic habits that are practiced within the region
but trend nationally. Much like the long shadow of Puritan studies cast
on the field of American Religious history, telescopic attention to
antebellum religion can obscure evangelical Protestant embrace of modern
industry and its mass-produced goods from the interpretive frame. To see
those habits requires a broader focus, one that may include consumer
habits along with church doctrine. For such a possibility, see Bethany
Moreton, *To Serve God and Wal-Mart: The Making of Christian Free
Enterprise* (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2009).

see Manuel A. Vasquez, *The Brazilian Popular Church and the Crisis of
Modernity* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998). It also
assumes that in terms of theological doctrine and religious practice,
southern evangelicals were not of one mind or spirit, particularly on
matters of race. Joel Williamson has argued that monolithic depictions
of southern ideology dismiss complex historical patterns of racial
conflict and change, especially during the period between 1850 and 1915,
a period he refers to as "The Great Changeover" in race relations. Joel

[^8]:  Most of the Baptist churches discussed in this essay were
associated with the Southern Baptist Convention. Use of the term
"southern Baptist" is meant to emphasize material practice over
denominational identity and to suggest that their practices were
relevant to broader evangelical developments in the American South. Love
for indoor baptisteries was not limited to SBC churches and as evidenced
in the opening example, it could even strike a Methodist. Drawing on
selected historical cases, the argument is intended to apply to Baptist
churches and churchgoers who considered themselves southern and
expressed interest in indoor baptisteries, which at times may extend
beyond geographically defined boundaries of the American South. On the
difficulty of state-based definitions of the South, see William James

[^13]:  FBC Richmond also constructed its baptistery around the
same time as northern Baptist churches. To get a sense of regional
comparison, consider the First Baptist Church of America in Providence,
Rhode Island, the oldest Baptist church in the United States. FBC
Providence was "the first Baptist meeting house in New England to have a
steeple," erected in 1775 and measuring 185 feet high. The church made
additional improvements in the early nineteenth century, adding new pews
in 1832 and installing an organ in 1834. It constructed an interior
baptistery in 1838, surrounding it with the English Georgian
architectural style commonly used in Anglican churches. "Exterior
portico and steeple and many interior elements, such as the Palladian
window behind the high pulpit, the fluted Tuscan columns, the groined
arches in the balcony, and the split pediments over the doors," were
layered onto the basic design of a plain Baptist structure. The
construction of the indoor baptistery at FBC Providence, like at FBC
Richmond, also preceded the availability of a public water system, which
was not completed until after 1864, under the leadership of Mayor Thomas
Doyle (1827–1886), who was memorialized as a "Pioneer of Urban Renewal."

local church historian, 26 June 2008. The possibility of both blacks and
whites being baptized in the same pool of water could have been too much
for some white members' sense of spiritual and racial purity,
particularly the white male leaders who called a second meeting to
approve plans for segregating the congregation. But this is purely
speculative, and may be a projection of later prohibitions concerning
interracial bathing back onto this time period. In the Jim Crow South,
indoor baptisteries were constructed within racially segregated
congregations. Much like with the segregation of public swimming pools,
indoor baptisteries in segregated churches eliminated the possibility of
immersing blacks and whites in the same body of water. By moving the
baptistery indoors in the early twentieth century, southern Baptists,
whether consciously or nor, eliminated the danger of what they perceived
as a racial indiscretion from their distinguishing ritual practice. A
heightened concern among southern whites to maintain racial, spiritual,
and physical purity may help explain the widespread adoption of indoor
baptisteries in the New South. They were celebrated as a modern
technology, but their implementation had racial consequences.
Industrialization made baptisteries more accessible to southern Baptists
at the same time that southerners struggled to define and defend
racially segregated spaces in the early twentieth century. These
included the secular consumer spaces of trains and theatres (where
passengers drank from individual cups and sat in segregated seats) and
the religious consumer spaces of local churches (where worshipers took
communion from individual cups and were baptized in segregated

Culture* (New York: St. Martin's Press, 2000). Evangelical identity was
strongly solidified in biracial congregations from the 1830s to the
1860s. Charles Irons, *The Origins of Proslavery Christianity: White and
Black Evangelicals in Colonial and Antebellum Virginia* (Chapel Hill:
University of North Carolina Press, 2008), has argued that black
conversion and participation in biracial congregations had the
concomitant outcome of reinforcing white superiority and Biblical
justifications for slavery. When black Protestants left those
congregations for their own independent churches after the Civil War,
white evangelicals struggled to redefine their racial superiority and
used segregation as a tool to reinforce racial boundaries.

building for white members, Jeter professed to "unusual barrenness" in
the church. He also protested liturgical changes, including
instrumentally accompanied music, which he referred to as "mechanical
music." He eventually resigned in 1848, turning down an offer from the
church to raise his salary from $1,000 to $1,500, and traveled west to

proximity for the policing of social norms in Protestant congregations:
"The fact the every Virginian, for example, was required by law to
attend church services each week was designed to reinforce the moral
policing of the church-wardens by bring people together within sight and
touch of each other to hear the moral precepts of the community
explained." Mathews, *Religion in the Old South*, 4.

[^24]:  Black Baptists in Alexandria later built their own indoor
baptistery in the early twentieth century, once they gained the material
resources needed to modernize their congregation. For most of the 1800s,
members of the Colored Baptist Society "baptized outdoors in Huntington
Creek and at various sties along the Potomac River. In 1900, they moved
to a site at "Battery Rodgers near the Woodrow Wilson Bridge." In 1920,
they constructed their first "indoor pool" at the Alfred Street Baptist
Church. Its members continued to use the pool "in various states of
disrepair" until 1980, when it moved to a new church building, which
included a new baptistery. Correspondence with Alton S. Wallace, 19
February 2010. Wallace does not mention the construction of an indoor
baptistery in his otherwise thorough history of Alfred Street Baptist
Church. He does include a detailed time line at the end of the book,
which I summarize as follows. In 1806, black members of the Alexandria
Baptist Society organized their own Colored Baptist Society, though it
remained within the white governing body of the former society. In 1810,
white leaders permitted the first black minister to preach to its black
members. Slaves from Mount Vernon joined the Colored Baptist Society in
1815. In 1819, the Alexandria Baptist Society allowed the Colored
Baptist Society to worship independently at 313 South Alfred Street.
Wallace, *I Once Was Young*, 233–235.

[^25]:  Black Baptists often changed their congregational names to
distance themselves from the implied racial placeholder of a (white)
First Baptist Church. For example, the Colored Baptist Society of
Alexandria changed its name to the First African Baptist Church in 1855
and then to the First Colored Baptist Church in the 1870s. But then in
1888, it changed its name once more to Alfred Street Baptist Church to
avoid being confused with the white congregation, which had changed its
name from Alexandria Baptist Church to First Baptist Church Alexandria.
Wallace, *I Once Was Young*, 233–235. In comparison, black Baptists in
Siler City, North Carolina, organized as First Baptist Church in 1919.
But they later changed their name to North Sixth Avenue First Baptist
Church, to designate the location of the congregation and distinguish it
from the downtown white congregation of First Baptist Church Siler City.
According to the church history, they returned to their original name of
First Baptist Church after North Sixth Avenue was renamed Martin Luther
King Jr. Boulevard in 1991. Annie Fox, "The Story and History of First
Baptist Church," in *First Baptist Church, 75th Anniversary, 1919–1994*
(history compiled by and in the collection of the First Baptist Church
of Siler City, Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd., n.d.), unpaginated. A copy
of this document was obtained from the town manager, Town of Siler City.
As of 2005, the church marquee stated the name of the congregation as
First Missionary Baptist Church. Both examples illustrate the difficulty
of referring to two churches by the same name.

African Baptist Church in Savannah in 1778, prior to white Baptist plans
to construct a downtown building. Bryan, a black Baptist minister,
converted Thomas Polhill, the son of a white Episcopal minister and one
of the key figures mentioned above in the initial city planning. By
1830, Bryan's congregation numbered twenty-four hundred members. Despite
the fact that the First African Baptist Church was both chronologically
first and much larger than its white counterpart, the downtown church
for white members "was referred to on the streets and even in its own
Minutes as "First Baptist." It was not until 1921, however, that its
name was officially changed from "Savannah Baptist" to "First Baptist."

of state laws concerning baptism, see the *Biography of London
Ferrill.*Ferrill, a slave who was converted and baptized at a revival,
was allowed to travel and preach the gospel. In one instance, however,
the law prohibited him from baptizing new converts. Based on the
narrative, it appears those converts were white Virginians. It reads,
"He (Ferrill) commenced preaching, and the people appeared to receive
the word gladly, and when he had gained about fifty converts who were
ready to be baptised which ceremony he was not authorised to perform by
the Virginia law, he procured the services of Preacher Bowles, and he
baptised them. The white people frequently invited Ferrill to their
houses to sing for them, as he was considered a great singer, and was
sent for, far and near, to preach funeral sermons when the servants
would die." Ferrill is later described as having a desire to leave the
state of Virginia. After the death of his master, he bought a wagon and
two horses and moved with his wife to Kentucky. There he "continued to
preach, baptizing in the Ohio river at Maysville and Covington, in
Elkhorn, Town Fork, and in all the ponds for miles around Lexington. A
pool was then constructed in the Church lot in which he baptized two
hundred and twenty persons in one hour and twenty-five minutes, and
sixty at another time, in forty-five minutes and has baptized, in all,
upwards of five thousand." *Biography of London Ferrill, Pastor of the
First Baptist Church of Colored Persons, Lexington, KY*(Lexington, Ky.:

[^37]:  This story is based on notes from an informal interview
with Reverend Greg Burris, pastor of Rocky River Baptist Church (6
October 2006). 

[^38]:  Other factors may have played a role in the construction of
indoor baptisteries, such as proximity to water or pollution from
cities. In the case of Siler City, these explanations are less
persuasive. Using the terrain feature on Google Maps
([http://maps.google.com/](http://maps.google.com/)), FBC Siler City is
roughly 4,000 feet from Loves Creek and only 1,200 feet from a tributary
of that creek. In comparison, Rocky River Baptist Church is
approximately 4,500 feet from Rocky River and 3,000 feet from Nick
Creek. Loves Creek Baptist is about 3,500 feet from Rocky River and
2,000 feet from Loves Creek. Distance to water then was likely not an
issue. In terms of pollution, FBC Siler built its indoor baptistery
before local factories reached large-scale production levels. Also, raw
sewage should not have been too much of an issue, since outhouses were
used. However, animal excrement was a real problem, as a position of
"Public Scavenger" was created in 1914 with the job of removing dead
animals and excrement from city limits. Pollution of local streams was a
possibility, though members of FBC Siler could have more easily walked a
short distance upstream to avoid those potential problems than
maintained indoor baptisteries without using public water or
electricity. Early baptisteries often smelled of mold and mildew as
well. This suggests that Baptists based their decision to baptize
indoors on more than just sanitation alone. For a more sustained account
of the religious and industrial development of Siler City, see Chad E.

as the rightful inheritor of European civilization was most clearly and
grandly demonstrated at the Chicago World's Fair of 1893. Alan
Trachtenberg describes how the architecture of the White City reflected
classical, Gothic, and Renaissance styles. In the displays of the White
City, "architecture" stood for "educated and tasteful *picturing*" and
it was used to associate artistic displays with "wealth, and the power
to donate and administer with social station and training." Alan
