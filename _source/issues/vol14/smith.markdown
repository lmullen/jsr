Inspired by historian Michael O'Brien's important writings on antebellum
southern intellectual history, the contributors to this eclectic
anthology examine the degree to which the Old South was "modern" in
ambition and outlook. Most historians describe the Old South as
insular, backward, and provincial, a pre-modern land wedded to
tradition, to an agrarian pre-modern *Weltanschauung*, in order to
retain the region's political economy of slavery.

The fifteen contributors to *The Old South's Modern Worlds* disagree,
arguing that pre-Civil War southerners were a diverse lot, fully engaged
in the cosmopolitan modernizing trends of the nineteenth century,
including moral reform, urbanization, industrialization, and territorial
expansion. The editors insist that the essays in the collection
interpret the Old South "on its own terms and as an active participant
in, and even promoter of, change and progress" (3). In doing so they
add a new twist to the old debate over southern "exceptionalism." Rather
than "making Southern exceptionalism the analytical start or finish,"
the authors in this collection assert that the Old South was
"exceptional" to the extent that it "did not fit comfortably within the
dichotomies that have historically defined the literature of the
antebellum South" (19).

The editors arrange the fourteen essays (followed by O'Brien's
"Afterword") into five parts. In Part One, Peter S. Onuf, Matthew Mason,
and Brian Schoen contextualize the antebellum South within international
ideas of "nation," proslavery thought, and interdependent political
economies. Next, Larry E. Hudson Jr., Steven Deyle, and James L. Hudson
examine slavery in a modernizing context. Frank Towers, William G.
Thomas, and L. Diane Barnes follow with essays on southern urbanization,
economic modernization, and free and slave labor, respectively. In Part
Four, Charles F. Irons, Andrew K. Frank, and Craig Thompson Friend treat
missionary activity, Native American policy, and gender roles,
respectively. Finally, Marc Egnal and Edward L. Ayers consider the "long
view" of the South, addressing questions of modernization and suggesting
how the Civil War, emancipation, and Reconstruction figured into world
history.

Though historians will find it disappointing that this anthology
devotes so little attention to religion, they nonetheless will welcome
Irons's excellent essay "Zion in Black and White: African-American
Evangelicals and Missionary Work in the Old South." According to Irons,
whites not surprisingly considered the conversion of enslaved men and
women an essential initiative in the late antebellum period. His
contribution is to document how African Americans participated in three
key ministries---colonization, missions to evangelize the slaves, and
international (African) missions. This activity, Irons writes "both adds
weight to the emerging redefinition of antebellum Southern Protestantism
as modern and reveals new lines of influence that blacks exerted on the
development of Southern evangelism" (210--11). Beyond this, black
participation in these ministries illumines "the difficult trade-offs
that black Southerners were forced to make within biracial churches as
they balanced sometimes-competing desires for racial uplift, personal
fulfillment, and the redemption of corrupt social systems" (211).

Despite its strengths in underscoring degrees of modernity in the Old
South, especially in its slave economy, *The Old South's Modern Worlds*
lacks a sense of dialogue between the authors and those contemporary
historians who disagree with their interpretive framework. Egnal's
"Counterpoint: What if Genovese Is Right? The Premodern Outlook of
Southern Planters" appears almost as an afterthought, the editors
burying their explanation for its inclusion in an endnote, stating that
Egnal's piece "seeks to further debate on reinterpreting the history of
the antebellum South" (283n).

Notwithstanding this imbalance, this collection highlights how today's
historians increasingly define the Old South as modern-minded. It should
serve as an excellent teaching text.
