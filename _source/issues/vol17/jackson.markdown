George Gallup famously dubbed 1976 “the year of the evangelical.” That year, the rest of the country took notice of a certain strand of American evangelical Protestantism. The coalition, however, was many decades in the making, and scholars of American religious history do not know nearly enough about the behind-the-scenes preparations. In far too many accounts, the evangelical coalition emerges – like a prim, demure Athena – fully formed. In this telling, fundamentalists were minding their own business, tenderly and self-consciously nursing wounds they had incurred at the Scopes Trial a half-century before, until the maelstrom of sex, drugs, and rock ‘n roll we now know as “the Sixties” compelled them to act in the service of God and country. 

Over the past five years, a number of scholars have challenged this depiction.[^1] Molly Worthen’s *Apostles of Reason* joins these revisions as a most welcome addition. Worthen argues that the anti-intellectual streak often identified in American evangelicalism is actually an authority problem. This dilemma manifests itself in the “struggle to reconcile reason with revelation, heart with head, and private piety with the public square” (2). The problem ensues from doctrine at the very heart of the Protestant project: sola scriptura. Long before Roland Barthes described the difficulties of establishing a text’s one true meaning, Protestants lived this dilemma. As one of Worthen’s sources laments:

>For if he chooses one position, [the Protestant] chances being branded as a Himmler-type reactionary; but if he chooses the opposite, he risks being herded with atheistic pinks and homosexuals. If he proposes to make the Bible his touchstone and guide, he is engulfed by a torrent of literature purporting to show that the Bible’s social teaching sanctions everything from state lotteries and genocide to ship-picketing, blood donations to the Viet Cong, and tossing Molotov cocktails at heads of state. (180)

Having argued their way out of a Pope, each individual Protestant believer must work out the Bible’s meaning more or less alone, albeit always in conversation – and sometimes in conflict – with other interpretations. This old story, Worthen tells us, is key to understanding American evangelicalism’s mid-century inefficacy.

Worthen begins with an intellectual and cultural history of neo-evangelicalism, the name that an influential group of second-generation fundamentalists took when they wanted to slough off the various excesses and absurdities of their predecessors. Theological conservatives all, these neo-evangelicals wanted more than anything for their ideas to be taken seriously. Beginning in the 1940s, they set out to build an infrastructure to help make it happen.  Yet they found themselves still having to argue, like their fundamentalist fathers, for a literal reading of the Bible. This position put them severely at odds with the dominant theological spirit of the age, modernism, whose proponents thought of the good book not as the word of God, but rather as a haphazard collection of ancient Jewish mythology and metaphor-laden missives concerning spats between bands of argumentative Greeks on the far edge of a crumbling Roman empire. By the time neo-evangelicals began to get seriously organized, the modernists had consolidated their hold on the most prestigious and influential university theology departments. Thus, neo-evangelicals found themselves in an acclivous match against an impressively-outfitted foe. They also had considerable trouble coaxing many of their theologically-conservative allies - to give in entirely to the battle metaphor - to fight on the same front. A good number of such allies were actually deployed in entirely different wars, often against denominations (and even congregations) that ought to have been confederates. The lack of a commanding officer, Worthen demonstrates, made this battlefield confusion practically inevitable. Worthen’s recounting of these maneuvers is thorough and convincing, focusing both on the campaign against the modernist heresy and the neo-evangelical effort to neutralize “come-outers” like Bob Jones and Carl McIntire. 

Worthen explores two areas in which theologically-conservative evangelicals were forced to deal with the problem of authority: the Bible college and foreign missions. When a newly expanded and suddenly flush federal government decided to pay college tuition for the millions of GI’s coming back from World War II, Bible Colleges risked losing out on the bonanza. Having long “exalted the common sense of the layman whose faith was unmuddled by the mystifications of the so-called experts” (102), these colleges often lacked formal accreditation.  Many feared that, when knocking at the doors of the accrediting agencies, Bible colleges would have to run the Bible right off campus. But knock they must, and knock they did, with predictable results. The agencies demanded many of the very curricular revisions that Bible-college defenders had feared.  The most problematic of these required a steadfast allegiance to the principle of academic freedom and expansion of the liberal arts, usually at the expense of theology. By the mid-1960s, the literary magazine at Wheaton College (“the fundamentalist Harvard”) under the editorial guidance of one Wesley Earl (Wes) Craven published “disturbing and morally complex stories” (115) that illustrated precisely, for many, the problem of bowing to secular dictates. Bible college administrators had little choice, however.  If they had failed to reform, a good many would have found themselves out of business. 

A similar process unfolded in foreign missions. As more and more African and Asian countries shrugged off their colonial masters, Protestant evangelists “[struggled] with their reputations as agents of the white man’s oppression” (125). The representatives of theological liberalism who stayed on after the British, French, Dutch, and Portuguese left paid far more attention to local culture than traditional missionaries, and they focused their efforts on projects that might help these newly independent citizens live more comfortable lives. Postcolonial missionaries took local culture seriously and tried to find ways to respect its prerogatives; this “anthropological turn” went a long way toward stamping out the ethnocentric (and often blatantly racist) evangelism of the colonial era. But it also caused some concern among Worthen’s theologically conservative evangelicals. Still intent on converting locals in the traditional way, Christianity was for them a matter of belief more than of action. While infrastructure projects were not offensive per se, they failed to solve the central problem of sin. Yet even these same evangelicals learned that effective ministry required them to take culture, history, and current affairs seriously. The truth of the Word now failed to suffice. Too often for their liking, evangelicals were caught between their modernist adversaries, who spent most of their time building roads and digging latrines, and their charismatic brethren, who were perfectly willing to win converts by “performing demon exorcisms, speaking in tongues, and surrendering to the Spirit” all of which, by the middle of the twentieth century, had begun to play better in Palau than it did in Peoria (125). 

Worthen’s slightly less convincing exploration of the evangelical left in the 1960s seems to belong to another book. Her discussions of Francis Schaeffer and Rousas John Rushdoony, while superficially linking them to J. Gresham Machen and the fundamentalist-modernist controversy, makes Schaeffer and Rushdoony seem too sui generis. Though strange, these men also seem just the kind of graduates that theologically conservative colleges and seminaries like Wheaton, Westminster, and the early incarnation of Fuller hoped to produce. Far more interesting than anything in the last part of this study - and a curious absence considering the book’s thesis – are Billy Graham’s position as a trusted adviser to almost every American president since Nixon and Abraham Vereide’s (and, later, Doug Coe) elevation of the National Prayer Breakfast to a central event in the DC calendar. Rooted in the theology of the fundamentalist movement, these men somehow acquired a level of authority that seems a bit out of sync with the story Worthen tells. How did they manage to overcome the central problem that her thesis rightly identifies?

Anyone who has ever spent time with the collections that Worthen quarried for *Apostles of Reason* will immediately appreciate her skilled mining. Although these archives are first-rate, with patient and painstaking professionals in charge, these vast collections contain difficult-to-navigate terrain. They are full of dead-end passages, irritating and potentially lethal minutiae (membership lists, accounting records), and the echoes of theological clashes the details of which would exhaust and confound Jesus himself. Worthen, though, makes expert sense of all of it, deploying precisely the right kinds of evidence with enviable aplomb and a deft writing hand. Particularly impressive is Worthen’s ability to weave the story of American evangelicalism back into the narrative of mainstream American history and, perhaps more importantly, to make it appear to matter. Anyone interested in recent American history will profit from reading Apostles of Reason; Worthen’s insights are relevant to almost all of the conversations scholars have been having about the politics and culture of the middle decades of the American century.
