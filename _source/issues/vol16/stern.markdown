Bryan Giemza's work defies simple categorization. It draws from a
variety of disciplines, including literary studies, ethic studies,
southern studies, and history. In this rich and complex study, Giemza
seeks to add a chapter to the story of American Irish Catholics and to
the story of the American South. Well-versed in these subjects, Giemza
previously has co-authored a biography of the "Poet-Priest of the
South," Father Abraham Ryan, and edited a biographical dictionary of
southern authors. His latest work opens with a rather dense but
necessary discussion of terminology, in which he explores the various
ways writers have used labels like "Irish," "Scotch-Irish," and "Irish
American." Explaining his own use of "Irish," "Catholic," and
"southern," he defines each very broadly (even including as southern
Irish Catholics writers who claimed not to be), but avoids
over-simplifications. He understands southern Irish Catholicism less in
terms of background or religious affiliation than as a lens through
which a writer viewed the world.

Giemza's stated goal is modest. He denies that he has "perceived a
revisionist truth that others have overlooked," but hopes instead that
by "pointing to what was there all along," he will help scholars view
southern Irish writers as integral to understanding both southern and
Irish American literature (22). In fact, however, he does this and a
good deal more. His wide-ranging work spans from the first Irish
American novel, published in Virginia in 1817, to contemporary writers
like Pat Conroy. He discusses numerous authors, such as Flannery
O'Connor, about whom it is by now difficult to say anything new, as well
as others who will be much less familiar to readers. Most significantly,
he demonstrates how southern Irish Catholics, as both insiders and
outsiders in southern society, wrote from a unique perspective. He
argues that, despite obvious tensions between Irish Catholic culture and
evangelical southern culture, strong affinities bound the two, including
acceptance of social hierarchies, distrust of modernism, a sense of
connection to the dead, and of course, the experience of defeat in
rebellion. Though other scholars have similarly noted how Catholicism
fit naturally into the worldview of the southern ruling class, Giemza
develops this argument by analyzing literature that not only reflected
southern worldviews but also interpreted and shaped them. While not
claiming an exclusive or unique role for Irish Catholic writers, Giemza
argues that they too must be part of the story of how the South came to
be.

Giemza's work is an excellent resource for those interested in the
construction of southern identity, particularly the role of Irish
Catholics writer in that process. Scholars and students of southern
literature will certainly profit from his wide-ranging references to
authors and theorists. This work may be challenging for readers with a
more casual interest, as Giemza presupposes a great deal of familiarity
with various authors and sources, and his writing, although often
elegant and witty, is not always as clear as it might be. But for those
willing to follow him on a tour through nearly two hundred years of
literature, he offers new insights into the ways that Irish Catholics
help shape the South.
