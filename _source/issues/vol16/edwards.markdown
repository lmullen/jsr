    the 50th Anniversary of the Scopes Trial

## Introduction

"Reporters representing national news media say that Dayton is little
changed. They wonder what Dayton has planned to celebrate the 50th
anniversary of the Scopes Trial. Dayton, in return, wonders what it is
expected to celebrate." -- Martha Garland, columnist for the *Dayton
Herald* July 17, 1975.[^1]

As the humid air began to breeze across the Tennessee Valley in the
summer of 1975, the residents of the small town of Dayton collectively
held their breath in anticipation. Fifty years prior, the eyes of the
nation had momentarily turned toward this unassuming section of East
Tennessee for what was then heralded as the "Trial of the Century," an
event from which many in Dayton believed their town had never quite
recovered. In 1925, the state of Tennessee tried a Rhea County high
school teacher who was eventually found guilty of teaching evolution in
his biology classroom, a crime that directly violated the recently
passed Butler Act, which forbade evolutionary teaching in all public
schools in the state. Although popular history remembers *State of
Tennessee v. John Thomas Scopes* mostly for the high-profile celebrities
that represented both the defense and prosecution, Dayton still felt the
lasting effects of the trial even fifty years after Clarence Darrow and
William Jennings Bryan departed from the Dayton train depot, the former
to his home in Chicago and the latter to Arlington National
Cemetery.[^2] "Bryan died five days after the trial; Darrow died in
1938; and Scopes died in 1970," the *Dayton Herald* boldly informed its
readers in an article commenting on the few meager commemorative events
planned for the fiftieth anniversary. "It was more their trial than it
was Dayton's."[^3]

While the flat plateau of Middle Tennessee might seem a world away from
the mountains of the eastern part of the state, the mood in the capitol
building in Nashville was surprisingly similar to that in Dayton in
1975. Two years before, on April 30, 1973, the state of Tennessee passed
the mundane-sounding "Chapter 377 of the 1973 Public Acts of Tennessee,"
known officially as the "Theory and Fact Law." This law mandated that
all biology textbooks used in Tennessee public schools which discussed
any theory "about origins or creation of man and his world" must give
equal time to other theories, "including, but not limited to, the
Genesis account in the Bible."[^4] In other words, Tennessee had again
revived the exact same issue that brought it so much negative attention
in 1925 with the Butler Act: evolution in public schools. This time,
however, they were not outlawing evolution. Instead, they were
instituting the nation's first "equal time" law, requiring biology
teachers statewide to give equal attention to *all* theories of
creation, even that of the Bible. This law, nicknamed the "Genesis
Bill," did not last long. In 1975, a few months before Dayton held its
halfhearted fiftieth anniversary celebration of the Scopes Trial, a US
District Court ruled the "Theory and Fact Law" unconstitutional.

No one was more disappointed in the District Court's decision to
overturn the Genesis Bill than Dr. Russell Artist, a biology professor
at David Lipscomb College in Nashville.[^5] Since the late 1950s, Artist
had spearheaded his own campaign to get creationist textbooks approved
by the Tennessee Textbook Commission for use in public schools. Dr.
Artist was both a minister in the Church of Christ and a devoted
scientist with a doctorate in biology. He was also a member of several
creationist societies, the author of his own creationist biology
textbook, and an active leader in the push for the Genesis Bill. It is
highly unlikely that the Tennessee House or Senate would have proposed
any type of "equal time" legislation without Artist's influence. His
connections with national creationist organizations---as well as
sympathetic members of the Tennessee legislature---certainly helped. When
the Genesis Bill finally became law in 1973, Artist felt an incredible
sense of accomplishment. "It is time that men of science who would like
to restore the trustworthiness of Scripture in matters of science should
be heard," he proclaimed in a letter written ten days before the bill's
passage.[^6]

Tennessee's Genesis Bill was a crucial milestone for creationism in the
United States for two reasons. First, the bill represented the earliest
successful legal step in the shift from biblical to scientific
justifications against teaching evolution.[^7] Although the Genesis Bill
was not an antievolution bill like the Butler Act was fifty years prior,
it reflected a growing trend within the creationist movement toward
relegating evolution to the level of an unprovable theory, thus making
evolution *equal* to other creation theories such as the biblical
account. It called into question the perceived dogmatism associated with
evolutionary teaching, setting the stage for creationist arguments that
evolution, like Christianity, was a philosophical and inherently
faith-based concept. The Genesis Bill demonstrated a fundamental shift
in creationism that had been taking place for decades after the Scopes
Trial. The Bible alone no longer provided a viable reason for proposing
legislation against the teaching of evolution in 1973. Scientific
rationale was more important, due in part to the renewed interest in
scientific teaching brought on by the Cold War and exemplified by the
Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS) textbook standards
implemented in the early 1960s. Second, the Genesis Bill was the first
version of an "equal time" law passed by a state legislature. Intended
to go into effect in 1975, exactly fifty years after the Scopes Trial
and only eight years after the state lifted its ban against evolution
placed by the Butler Act, a federal court overturned the law and the
Genesis Bill's textbook regulations never saw the light of day.

Despite the Genesis Bill's historical importance, scholars have written
very little about it outside the legal realm. Law journals have
published the only studies specifically addressing the Genesis Bill, and
thus these works have focused solely on its constitutional aspects and
the court cases that followed.[^8] The most comprehensive history of
creationism, historian of science Ronald Numbers's *The Creationists:
From Scientific Creationism to Intelligent Design*, fails to mention the
bill, despite its otherwise thorough treatment of the creationist
movement.[^9] One notable exception is legal historian Edward J.
Larson's 1985 work, *Trial and Error: The American Controversy Over
Creation and Evolution*.[^10] While Larson devotes only a few pages to
the Genesis Bill, his analysis nevertheless provides the groundwork for
further studies by placing the bill into the larger context of "equal
time" laws following the *Epperson v. Arkansas* ruling in 1968.
*Epperson v. Arkansas* was important, Larson asserts, because it ruled
that laws prohibiting the teaching of evolution were unconstitutional.
This included Tennessee's Butler Act, which was struck down the year
prior. This forced creationism advocates to change their tactics if they
wanted creationist theories to be taught in public school classrooms.
Larson views the Genesis Bill as the "first breakthrough" in the
movement to "require the classroom presentation of creationist religious
concepts as a foil to evolutionary teaching."[^11]

Tennessee's quickly forgotten Genesis Bill did more to shape the
controversy over creationism in the classroom than any other court
decision or creation bill that sprouted up across the country throughout
the 1970s and 1980s. But why, nearly fifty years after the state
experienced such universally negative publicity surrounding the Scopes
Trial, did Tennessee resurrect a controversy that would reinforce the
exact same stereotypes that harmed their image so badly in 1925? With H.
L. Mencken's scathing portrayals of backward, superstitious,
holy-rolling Tennesseans undoubtedly flashing through their minds, the
state legislature's vote for the Genesis Bill forced Tennessee to
confront the memory of the Scopes Trial, reopening a wound that still
had not fully healed after fifty long years. This time, however, the
scenery had changed somewhat. Instead of the dusty small-town streets of
Dayton, David Lipscomb College's picturesque campus in the bustling
urban capital of Nashville provided the backdrop for yet another
old-fashioned Tennessee evolution debate.

## I. Russell Artist's Tennessee Campaign for Creation

"What's the matter with the evolutionists that they can't stand a
scrutiny by honest scientists? We're not telling them not to teach it ---
let them teach it all they want. The more it is taught, the better we
can point out the difficulties." -- Russell Artist in *The Tennessean*,
April 30, 1973

Four men sat huddled around a Nashville restaurant table in the summer
of 1972. Two were ministers in the Church of Christ, one was a state
senator from a small city in the northernmost corner of West Tennessee,
and the fourth was a gravely concerned biology professor on a personal
mission to save the minds and souls of Tennessee's schoolchildren. Dr.
Russell Artist came to this informal meeting with an idea, one that he
had cultivated in various forms for well over a decade. As he sat across
from Senator Milton Hamilton of Union City that day, he likely knew this
could be his best chance yet to see his idea realized.[^12] It was this
conversation, born over cups of coffee and some small-talk, that
eventually led to the passage of a bill that would resurrect a part of
Tennessee's past many of its residents would rather forget.

Almost fifty years earlier, Dayton played host to a very similar scene.
Some of the town's influential business leaders met each other at
Robinson's Drug Store on a hot day in late spring, sipping Coca-Colas
and chatting excitedly about an ad the American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) placed in the *Chattanooga Times* on May 4, 1925. The ACLU was
searching for a Tennessee teacher willing to test out the newly-passed
Butler Act which prohibited the teaching of evolution in state schools.
When Dayton businessmen saw the ACLU's offer, they saw dollar signs.
Crowded around a small round table in the center of the drug store,
Dayton's business boosters plotted a media event they thought would
surely put their little town on the map for good.[^13] While the memory
of the Scopes Trial had already moved to folklore status by 1972, there
is little doubt that it weighed on Russell Artist's mind as he and
Senator Hamilton sat in the Nashville restaurant planning their more
modern assault on evolutionary teaching. They wanted to proceed with
caution, shying away from another media circus. They did not want the
ghosts of Dayton rising again to haunt their state.

Despite the risks involved, Russell Artist was entirely devoted to his
cause of bringing the evolution debate back home to Tennessee. Born in
Francisville, Indiana in 1911, Artist earned a Bachelor of Science
degree from Butler University in 1939. He studied at the University of
Minnesota during the 1940s, eventually receiving a PhD in biology with a
specialization in botany.[^14] He left behind no indication that he was
particularly religious during his early days, and he described his
parents as having raised him in a "nominal Christian home."[^15]
According to Artist, the defining moment of his life came when he was
teaching at Westminster College in Salt Lake City, Utah between 1945 and
1947. Writing in the third person, he described in a biographical piece
how he underwent a religious awakening at age 35. "While teaching in
Utah he gained a new concept of science as a revelation of God rather
than a contradiction of God as his former materialistic theories had
held," he narrated. After this change in his scientific and religious
outlook, "he determined to dedicate his life to helping other people to
approach science studies from this point of view."[^16]

Artist's transformation was particularly notable because of his
affiliation with a church that had relatively little history debating
the merits or the evils of evolutionary theory. It was an affiliation
that three of the four men who met to discuss the problem of evolution
at the Nashville restaurant in 1972 shared: membership in the Church of
Christ. Begun in the early nineteenth century as part of the broader
Restoration Movement dedicated to a "restoration of the ancient gospel,"
the Church of Christ preached Biblical literalism and the belief that
they "were to speak where the Bible speaks and be silent where the Bible
is silent."[^17] They eschewed traditional denominations and instead
believed their church was both a direct continuation and a particularly
American renewal of the New Testament church. Even today, the Church of
Christ generally considers itself outside and above the more
conventional theological disputes that have shaped other denominations,
such as the rise of fundamentalism in the early twentieth century.
Members identify themselves simply as "Christians."[^18]

Wary of labels, denominational or otherwise, Church of Christ members
nevertheless fell on the conservative side of most issues, and evolution
was no exception. Biblical literalism was one of the few common threads
that held the Church of Christ together as a cohesive body of believers,
and for members like Russell Artist this literalism certainly included
the Genesis account of creation. The antievolution movement was most
prominently made up of conservative protestant Christians who identified
themselves as fundamentalists, a movement begun in the early twentieth
century that traditionally, albeit incorrectly, has been understood to
have retreated from its activism after the Scopes Trial in 1925.[^19]
Despite the fact that the church shared with fundamentalism a staunch
commitment to Biblical literalism, neither the Church of Christ nor
Artist self-identified as fundamentalist.[^20]

"I believe firmly that there is a God," Russell Artist wrote in his
first major publication on creation; "Science both admits and accepts
this inference."[^21] In many ways, Artist was emblematic of the new
type of creationist that emerged in the decades after 1925. Whereas the
antievolutionists who fought so vehemently against Darwinian evolution
in the 1920s arrived at their conclusions from an almost strictly
Biblical viewpoint, seeing evolution as a danger because it challenged
the literalist reading of Genesis that fundamentalists so cherished,
Artist and his contemporaries in the late 1950s and 1960s approached the
issue from a different angle. While these creationists held strong
religious beliefs, many had also earned advanced scientific degrees.
Instead of a movement led largely by fundamentalist preachers whose
primary resource in the fight against evolution was the Bible, these men
focused instead on proving that the Genesis account of creation and
evolution were equally valid theories that could be explained in
scientific terms. The entire movement shifted from "antievolutionist" to
"creationist"---from being *against* evolution to being *for* creation. It
was a change reflected in more than just their terminology.

The heightened Cold War paranoia of the 1950s necessitated this shift
within creationism. It was no accident that the Soviet Union's launch of
the Sputnik satellite in 1957 prompted an immediate reevaluation of
scientific teaching standards in public schools. If America was ever
going to catch up with Soviet technology, President Eisenhower reasoned,
then a massive overhaul of the education system, including a renewed
emphasis on science, must take place. It was in this Cold War context
that the National Science Foundation started funding the Biological
Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS) in 1959. The BSCS, as Edward Larson
describes, "set about rewriting high-school textbooks, and the leading
biologists serving on the Study boldly embraced evolution. The
appearance of the BSCS texts in the early sixties shattered the
thirty-year truce in legal activities enveloping the antievolution
issue."[^22] While the BSCS textbooks ushered evolution into public
schools across the country, they also elicited a backlash from
creationists. In 1961, creationists Henry M. Morris and John C. Whitcomb
released what would eventually become the most widely-read book on
creationism, *The Genesis Flood: The Biblical Record and its Scientific
Implications*, recharging the public evolution debate for a new
era.[^23]

Two years before Morris and Whitcomb published *The Genesis Flood*,
Russell Artist drafted his own creationist textbook for use in the
biology classes he taught at David Lipscomb College in 1959. The book
was Artist's attempt at dispelling the belief that the creationists of
the 1950s were the same as the antievolutionists of the 1920s. "I am
writing this textbook because I feel that it is needed," Artist revealed
in its introduction.[^24] An article on the textbook in *The Nashville
Tennessean* stated that "Christian men of science like Dr. Artist
believe that a Christian approach to scientific studies and research can
mean more to the world than rocket ships that may eventually go to the
moon."[^25] The use of the phrase "Christian men of science" to describe
Artist and his cohort was particularly telling, illustrating the vital
connection creationist scientists made between their scientific
credentials and their faith in the Genesis creation account. This
statement also reflected the Cold War tensions inherent in any
discussion of science education during this period, with Artist flatly
denying that the immediate concern over Sputnik and the Soviet space
program mattered more in the long-term than preserving Christian faith
within the sciences.

By the time the BSCS textbooks finally received approved for use in
public schools in 1963, Artist had used his own biology book, one that
utilized what he termed a "two-model approach," presenting both
evolution and the Genesis account of creation, for four years. Since
David Lipscomb College was a private Church of Christ-affiliated
university, however, he experienced no real resistance to his methods.
In a report written in 1963, Artist discussed the status of evolutionary
teaching in Tennessee. He argued that, in most colleges, "only in little
'islands' of influence is any remonstration made concerning the theory.
In none of these do I find a flat denial or an unreasonable avoiding of
examination of the claims of evolution doctrine; rather, there is on the
part of most of these a determination to see both sides of the issue
expressed." In a particularly candid lamentation of the state's storied
history, he concluded the piece by charging that "the film *Inherit the
Wind* has done little to raise up an attitude of serious inquiry into
the merits of either side but it has, in my opinion, done damage to both
sides. Ray Ginger's book, *Six Days or Forever?: Tennessee v. John T.
Scopes*, is prejudiced on the side of the evolutionist and seems to
indicate that all fundamentalists are ignorant people."[^26]

Artist's indictment of the two most popular representations of the
Scopes Trial at that time, the 1960 film *Inherit the Wind* which
parodies the trial and the 1958 historical work by Ray Ginger, shed
light on his view of the trial and also foreshadowed the issues he would
face fighting for creationism in public schools. He sympathized with
fundamentalists and lamented the negative images associated with them in
this statement, although his approach would ultimately attempt to right
what they had done wrong decades before. In 1967, the Tennessee
legislature repealed the Butler Act that fundamentalists had so
vehemently supported in 1925. *Epperson v. Arkansas* presented another
major challenge to future legal efforts against evolution a year later
in 1968.[^27]

For Artist, however, these were hardly setbacks. He had no intention to
make evolutionary teaching illegal again. Rather, he wanted his
"two-model approach" to be the standard, with the Genesis account of
creation discussed alongside the theory of evolution in every textbook
in the state. "Since evolution is <u>not</u> science, but a belief, a
philosophy," he argued, evolution would look foolish when placed next to
such a simple yet powerful creation story as the one in the Bible.[^28]
He began searching among like-minded Tennessee Christians for additional
support with his crusade, and he had little trouble finding it.

## II. Another Monkey Bill: The "Theory and Fact Law" of 1973

"Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the good folks in Dayton, Tennessee and
William Jennings Bryan College, we thank you for your vote." -- Rep. Bill
Carter of Rhea County to the Tennessee House of Representatives, April
26, 1973[^29]

Several years before Dayton's state representative triumphantly
announced his gratitude to those who voted in favor of the Genesis Bill,
Russell Artist was in the biology department at David Lipscomb College
doing his best to stir up some controversy among his fellow Church of
Christ members. "Brethren, I need your help to alert you to the tragic
inroad of the BSCS biology textbook series into our high schools," he
wrote in a pleading announcement printed in the Church of Christ's
official publication, the *Gospel Advocate*, in 1969. "Bluntly put, the
religion of biology---of evolution---is in our schools and the Bible with
its creation viewpoint is out! The Creation Research Society has now
written a high school textbook exposing the false claims of evolution
and upholding God as creator. Are you ready to help us meet the BSCS
evolutionary oriented textbooks?"[^30]

Although the majority of *Gospel Advocate* readers were unlikely to know
anything about the Creation Research Society, they were probably
familiar with the group's goals. Described by historian Ronald Numbers
as "the leading creationist organization of the late twentieth century,"
the Creation Research Society (CRS) helped define the tenets of
creationism and to disseminate them as widely as possible by 1963.[^31]
Initially made up of only ten strict creationists whom CRS member and
author of *The Genesis Flood* Henry Morris referred to as the "Team of
Ten," the society grew rapidly in the early 1960s.[^32] Although Russell
Artist was not one of Morris's "Team of Ten," he was certainly present
in the CRS almost from its inception. He eventually served as a
contributor to the CRS's most prized project, a high school biology
textbook entitled *Biology: A Search For Order in Complexity*.[^33] This
textbook was the first mass-published biology book to present evolution
and the Genesis account of creation as competing theories.

*Biology: A Search For Order in Complexity* defined "Creation" as "the
sum total of acts by the Creator or Supreme Being who brought into
existence the universe, the earth, and all life, including mankind, that
is therein."[^34] While the CRS was careful to remove explicit
references to Genesis, God, and the Bible from the text, their intent
remained clear. A "Creator" breathed life into the world, they argued,
and there was little more to the story than that. The book did teach
evolution; however, it also included an entire unit that called into
question basic tenets of the theory. The ideas presented by *Biology: A
Search For Order* in Complexity were far less dependent on Biblical
literalism than was Artist's own self-published textbook from 1959, but
the basic concepts were remarkably similar. Both books portrayed
evolution as an unprovable philosophical theory riddled with errors,
while "Creation" emerged as the only logical explanation for the origin
of species.

"The battle will not be easy," Artist admitted in a later *Gospel
Advocate* piece written in 1970, "for Tennessee has just recently
repealed the famous 'anti-Evolution Law,' often called the 'monkey law,'
and many are convinced that we are trying to 'turn back the
clock.'"[^35] He was acutely aware that his state would not be able to
shake its legacy as the home of "Monkey Town," yet he also sensed that
Tennessee's seemingly endless obsession with evolution might provide the
perfect opportunity for *Biology: A Search For Order in Complexity* to
introduce high schoolers to the CRS's newly-evolved, more scientific
creationism.[^36] Having appeared before the Tennessee Textbook
Commission several times between 1970 and 1973 asking for them to add
the book to its approval list, Artist showed no signs of giving up the
fight despite continued denials. As summer approached and classes ended
at David Lipscomb College in 1972, Artist contemplated a new strategy.

Artist's push for the Genesis Bill was something he undertook on his
own. Although he affiliated himself with the CRS, there is no evidence
that the group was involved with drafting or lobbying for the bill.
Without Artist's initiative, virtually any state in America could have
passed the nation's first "equal time" law. But Tennessee appeared to be
as good a choice as any, and the unlikely combination of a particularly
active creationist biologist and the precedent already set in the state
by the Butler Act only added fuel to the fire. When he planned his
fateful meeting with Senator Milton Hamilton in the summer of 1972,
there were no guarantees that the bill would make it any further than
the restaurant table where it was born.

The bill began, "Any biology textbook used for teaching in the public
schools, which expresses an opinion of, or relates to a theory about
origins or creation of man and his world shall be prohibited from being
used as a textbook in such system unless it specifically states that it
is a theory as to the origin and creation of man and his world and is
not represented to be scientific fact." Known officially as the "Theory
and Fact Law," it went on to stipulate that textbooks must give equal
space to all origins theories, "including, but not limited to, the
Genesis account of the Bible."[^37] It would not go into effect until
1975, presumably to give school systems enough time to purchase
appropriate textbooks that fit the guidelines set forth in the new law.
But, as Artist himself noted, *Biology: A Search For Order in
Complexity* might be the "only one at present that answers this
particular bill."[^38]

Senator Milton Hamilton of Union City introduced Senate Bill number 394
during the first week of April 1973, nearly a year after his meeting
with Russell Artist. On April 5, Dayton's state representative Bill
Carter penned a note in his weekly "Capitol Report" column in the local
paper saying he would like to be the House sponsor of the bill. "This
will be a complicated piece of legislation, and might be difficult to
pass," he warned, "but its passage means a lot to me and I know it does
to a large number of Rhea Countians."[39] Although Carter eventually
served only as a co-sponsor, he nevertheless had a particular interest
in the bill from its inception because of its unique link with the
community he served. "Since I unsuccessfully opposed the repeal of the
'Evolution Law' in 1968, I have been duty bound to do all I can to see
that this bill is passed," Carter later wrote in an article published
the same day the House approved a slightly amended version of the
Genesis Bill. "Evolution is being taught as a fact -- not just a theory.
Passage of this bill certainly will be one of my top three legislative
goals for this session."[^39] When it did in fact pass both houses of
the Tennessee legislature on April 30, 1973, Sen. Hamilton, Rep. Carter,
and Dr. Russell Artist were all delighted by their accomplishment.
Starting in 1975, the new textbook regulations would take effect. But as
with most controversial laws, the story of the Genesis Bill's passage
was not quite as simple as it seemed.

Artist's justification for the Genesis Bill involved a twofold argument.
He contended that evolution was so flimsy a theory that it should hardly
be considered more scientific than the Genesis account of creation,
while also claiming that both creation and evolution were philosophical
concepts rooted primarily in belief. It was the latter part of his
argument that won out in the actual text of the bill. All origin stories
had to be labelled as theories and not as scientific facts, it
commanded. Evolutionary theory, the Genesis theory, and presumably the
creation theories of all other religions on Earth must be represented in
textbooks statewide. Perhaps this was an unintended consequence on
Artist's part. In his zeal to see creationism taught alongside evolution
in biology classrooms, he had unwittingly downplayed the scientific
merits of "Special Creation" for which he had so passionately fought
since his religious conversion in the 1940s. Instead of a serious
discussion in the Tennessee legislature about the nature of science and
its intimate relationship with religion, as Artist had envisioned, any
objections legislators raised mostly centered on how the Genesis Bill
placed Christianity on the same level as both evolution and the creation
myths of other religions.

"The teachers of evolution are teaching religion!" Rep. Cecil Corley of
Gallatin charged. "The teaching of evolution has not furthered the cause
of science or biology. They are teaching that man is a God himself and
that there is no God. Religion is being taught in our textbooks, it is
the doctrine of the devil."[^40] Suddenly, the voices swirling through
the House and Senate chambers in Nashville began to sound an awful lot
like those that had filled the cramped courtroom in the Rhea County
courthouse during the summer of 1925. This was not a point that was lost
on the local and national media who swarmed into Tennessee during April
of 1973 searching feverishly for a good story. Rep. Thomas Burnett of
Jamestown, the House sponsor of the Genesis Bill, made sure to state for
the record that the bill "is not a monkey law. It is not designed to
make the people of Tennessee look foolish."[^41] But the link between
the new Genesis Bill and the Scopes Trial was undeniable, and the press
loved it. "Six years after repealing the anti-evolution law which led to
Tennessee's famed 1925 Monkey Trial, the state legislature has aligned
itself again with the Bible belt and passed another measure," chimed the
*Cleveland Banner*, "This time, however, the monkeys get equal space
with Adam and Eve."[^42]

On April 18, 1973, the day the Tennessee Senate started their floor
debates on the Genesis Bill surrounded in their chamber by television
cameras from around the country, a lone camera crew also arrived in
Dayton. This crew, representing the CBS Evening News with Walter
Cronkite, filmed a group of locals who discussed the Scopes Trial at the
Rhea County courthouse. The *Dayton Herald* printed an article about the
Senate debates and the visit from CBS, addressing the two events as if
they had occurred only coincidentally. Walter Cronkite wanted footage of
the courtroom where John Scopes was found guilty of teaching evolution,
and the Senate passed a new bill concerning origins. Despite the
*Herald's* wishful thinking, however, the two were naturally related,
and the senators in Nashville were all too aware of the similarities.
They severely limited their discussion of the bill in the Senate chamber
that day. When asked why by a Nashville newspaper, Sen. Hamilton
replied: "The reason there wasn't any debate is that the national TV
came down here with the idea they would make us look like a bunch of
nitpickers. You know, like barefoot Tennesseans."[^43]

Another senator, James White of Memphis, captured the mood in both the
Capitol and in Dayton when faced with more national ridicule over the
state's seemingly endless battle with Darwin. "Gentlemen," he began,
"today, a half a century after the Scopes Trial, when the eyes of the
nation---" He was cut off by a motion to cease his objection, but the
Speaker of the Senate allowed him to continue. The chamber grew quiet.
"---when the eyes of the nation were turned toward Tennessee for comic
relief, the Tennessee legislature is once again affording the nation the
chance to see Tennessee in action." A single laugh echoed from somewhere
nearby. "In our zeal to disclaim any historical kinship with the simian,
we may be acting in such a way as to cause people to think we're proving
our direct descent."[^44] Sen. White finished his comments, and his
colleagues quickly passed Senate Bill 394.

## III. Daniel v. Waters and the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Scopes Trial

Dear Citizens of Dayton: As I sat in my home this morning, the story of
your town was brought to my attention via the CBS morning news. It was
heart warming and refreshing to know there are still honest-to-goodness
God fearing people in our country. Your town looked so American and your
people so happy. I feel certain you must have very conservative
leadership. Be proud of your town's history, for your possession of
fundamentalism is a wonderful and rare thing. --Cordially, Mrs. Sam
Fondren of Columbus, MS[^45]

Governor Winfield Dunn received hundreds of letters about the Genesis
Bill during the spring of 1973. The bill quickly became a hot-button
issue throughout the entire state, prompting citizens to flood the
Governor's office with numerous fervent pleas in favor of, as well as
vehemently against, the bill. Unlike his political predecessor in 1925,
Dunn showed little interest in wading into such a sensitive and
potentially damaging debate. Decades earlier, Austin Peay, the Governor
of Tennessee when the state passed the Butler Act, had been enthusiastic
about signing into law the bill that would outlaw evolution and
eventually cement the Scopes Trial's place in history. Dunn, wishing not
to anger Tennesseans on either side, was far more timid. Perhaps he had
taken a valuable lesson from Peay's mistake, keeping both his commentary
and his signature to himself this time around.

Even without Gov. Dunn's explicit approval, the Genesis Bill became the
law of the land in Tennessee. The brief but intense media spotlight that
spilled across the state during April and early May of 1973 faded,
eventually being supplanted by criticism from the scientific community
instead. A particularly scathing article appeared in November of 1973 in
the journal *Science: New Series*, poking fun at Tennessee and invoking
the memory of the Scopes Trial for an eagerly receptive audience.
"Santayana's tag about those who cannot remember the past being
condemned to repeat it has apparently been forgotten in the state
legislature of Tennessee," Nicholas Wade began in his short piece
entitled "Evolution: Tennessee Picks A New Fight With Darwin." Wade's
article directly implicated Russell Artist as the culprit behind the
Genesis Bill, equating him and the Creation Research Society with "the
fundamentalists" and accusing them both of turning back the clock to the
1920s. "Artist tried to persuade the Tennessee state textbook commission
to adopt a biology textbook coauthored by him and other members of the
Creation Research Society," Wade charged. "When the commission refused
Artist approached Senator Hamilton, the author of the new law and, like
Artist, a member of the Church of Christ."[^46]

This article caused trouble for Russell Artist for two reasons. First,
it linked the Creation Research Society to the push for the Genesis
Bill, which beyond Artist's longstanding personal affiliation with the
society was untrue. It also tied Sen. Milton Hamilton to a specific
denomination, Artist's own Church of Christ, subtly planting the idea
that the Genesis Bill was some kind of conspiracy thought up by Church
of Christ members who wanted their church's view of creation to become
state law. Artist was especially concerned with the latter issue. On
December 12, 1973, he received a letter in response to Wade's article
from a fellow Church of Christ member. It encapsulated many of the
problems that followed Artist after the publicity surrounding the
Genesis Bill died down. "I was especially unhappy to see the church
mentioned by name. I'm sure that you and Sen. Hamilton would be the
first to admit you are not official spokesmen for the church," it read.
"I feel it is tragic that so many of my brethren who believe that the
events of Genesis 1:1-2:4 were completed in a literal 168 hours deny
that a Christian can interpret the scriptures differently. It is tragic
because many, especially our young people, who accept the premise that
evolution and the Bible are necessarily in conflict needlessly lose
their faith when convinced of evolution."[^47] The author struck a chord
with Artist, whose own religious awakening happened under remarkably
similar circumstances. Artist, however, had turned solely to the Bible
over evolution.

"I concede that, as mentioned in Sen. Hamilton's law, evolution is a
theory rather than a scientific fact. It disturbs me though that too
often the 'theory' vs. 'fact' argument is raised in lay discussions
without an adequate description of the nature of theories in scientific
epistemology," the letter continued. "Theories are certainly more than
the idle speculation they are implied to be in some sermons I've heard."
The signature at the bottom said simply, "Christian love, Dale Cannon,
PhD."[^48] It was this final statement about "theory vs. fact" that
prompted Artist to reply. The premise of the Genesis Bill centered on
the distinction between theories and facts in the science classroom,
however Cannon raised an important objection to this seemingly basic
assumption. Was it really accurate to label all stories about the
origins of life on earth as theories in the scientific sense? Would the
Genesis account of creation hold up to the same kind of scrutiny that
evolution had to in order to be considered a scientific theory? "A good
theory must allow us to predict on the basis of its statement," Artist
responded a few weeks later. "Well, we can certainly do that with
creation. We would predict that the universe would of necessity have
some order and some design if it were created --- and of course it
does."[^49]

Artist took particular offense at being accused of speaking on behalf of
his church. "Let me say to you truthfully, I myself did not mention the
Church of Christ at any time in my talk with him..." he argued,
referring to his interview with Nicholas Wade. "And he made a glaring
mistake in aligning Senator Hamilton with us; I believe he is a
Methodist. So much for that."[^50] Though he was well aware that not all
of his fellow members of the Church of Christ supported him, Artist
assured Cannon that the Genesis Bill was desperately needed in order to
combat the bias toward evolution being taught to children in their
biology classrooms throughout Tennessee. Discussion of what a scientific
"theory" meant had no bearing on whether or not the Genesis Bill was a
good idea for the state, Artist reasoned. "It was a people bill, not for
PhDs," he remarked.[^51]

The important scientific details that were largely overlooked in the
Genesis Bill's wording, however, were certainly cause for concern among
many creationists. Artist might have succeeded at getting the nation's
first "equal time" law on the books in Tennessee, but creationists
worried the bill's slippery language and stipulation that *all* theories
of human origins be given commensurate time in biology textbooks could
potentially do more harm than good to the more "scientific" brand of
creationism they were interested in popularizing. In 1974, leading
creationist Henry M. Morris published his own creationist textbook for
use in public schools entitled simply *Scientific Creationism*. Based in
part off of the CRS's approach in *Biology: A Search For Order in
Complexity*, Morris intended *Scientific Creationism* to be a
supplementary textbook in biology classes featured alongside more
traditional textbooks that discussed evolution. Under the rubric put
forth in the Genesis Bill, *Scientific Creationism* would have likely
been considered acceptable supplementary material if the law's
provisions ever had gone into effect.

"Teachers, students, pastors, and others can now be equipped with
factual information of the fallacies of evolution and evidence of
special creation," the back cover of *Scientific Creationism* read. "The
first seven chapters present only the scientific data, with a courteous,
positive treatment. The eighth and longest chapter provides an extensive
discussion of the Biblical aspects of creationism, placing the
scientific material in proper theological and Scriptural
perspective."[^52] Morris and his newly formed creationist society, the
Institute for Creation Research, sent out copies of the book to science
teachers across the country in order to persuade them to teach
creationism alongside evolution as two competing, yet equally valid,
scientific theories. There were two versions of the book, however. The
original included the eighth chapter on Biblical context, while the
"Public School Edition" omitted any references to the Bible as well as
all specifically Christian terms.[^53] It seemed that only a year after
Tennessee implemented the Genesis Bill, creationists were already
working on rebranding creationism in an even more scientific guise,
shedding religious terminology completely in materials intended for
public schools. Interestingly, Russell Artist's name was absent from the
list of contributors to *Scientific Creationism*.

The same year as Morris published *Scientific Creationism*, University
of Tennessee lawyer Frederic Le Clercq wrote an essay that resurrected
discussion of the Butler Act and also formed preliminary plans for a
legal case against the Genesis Bill. Le Clercq laid out in this article
the status of the "equal time" push by stating bluntly that
"creationists are making a determined effort to replace the theory of
evolution in public school science textbooks with the doctrine of Divine
or Biblical Creation, or its protean 'scientific' counterpart, special
or spontaneous creation."[^54] Le Clercq found the Genesis Bill
particularly troubling, arguing that the bill was in direct violation of
"the establishment, free exercise, and free speech clauses of the first
amendment and the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment."[^55]
He also clearly understood the key shift that had taken place in
creationist strategy over the previous fifty years, noting the
differences between the drive to "blot out" evolution in the 1920s and
the fight for equal emphasis on creationism in the 1970s.

Russell Artist and Frederic Le Clercq did not know one another in 1974,
but their paths would soon cross, and if a University of Tennessee
philosophy professor named Peter Bowman had anything to do with it, they
would cross in Dayton. Hardly as dramatic as the legendary showdown
between Clarence Darrow and William Jennings Bryan back in 1925, Le
Clercq and Artist both received a letter from Bowman in late 1973
requesting their participation in a symposium on Tennessee's Evolution
Laws set to take place some time prior to the celebration of the Scopes
Trial's fiftieth anniversary at the Rhea County courthouse. This
symposium would target the "citizens of Rhea" and would pose to its
panelists a question: "What kind of belief or value is the 'creationist'
account of the origin of man? Scientific or religious?"[^56]

Bowman intended this event to be an educational debate between academics
who were heavily invested in their particular stances on the Genesis
Bill, set against a backdrop that was powerful and still rather
troubling for many citizens of Tennessee. The end result was more
negative press for Dayton. As one newspaper editorial read, "Nearly 50
years after the historic Scopes monkey trial focused world attention on
this tranquil hamlet, you can still get an invitation to leave town by
speaking up for evolution."[^57] Held in early June of 1974 with around
250 Rhea County residents in attendance, the symposium featured three
creationist academics from local colleges, including Church of
God-affiliated Lee University and Dayton's own Bryan College. Frederic
Le Clercq acted as the sole dissenting voice.[^58] Notably absent from
the panel, however, was Russell Artist himself. Artist left behind
nothing about the event except the original project proposal in his
personal papers, therefore his reasons for not participating are
unknown.[^59] But although Le Clercq never got his opportunity to
confront Artist directly about the Genesis Bill, he soon had the chance
to present his complaints on a much grander stage.

On April 10, 1975, the United States Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit,
abruptly struck down the Genesis Bill in a case called *Daniel v.
Waters*. Frederic Le Clercq served as the attorney for the plaintiff,
representing Joseph C. Daniel, Jr. and three other Knoxville members of
the National Association of Biology Teachers (NABT). They charged that
the Genesis Bill was "patently unconstitutional," an assessment with
which the U. S. Court of Appeals agreed without even hearing any
arguments against it.[^60] Edward Larson described the quick *Daniel*
ruling as a "blanket condemnation" that is typically reserved "for
direct violations of established constitutional principles."[^61] The
District Court's decision affirmed an earlier case from March of 1975,
*Steele v. Waters*, which had challenged the Genesis Bill in the state's
Supreme Court. Many newspapers noted that the timely ruling occurred
exactly fifty years after the Butler Act was used to prosecute John
Scopes in Dayton, but otherwise the *Daniel v. Waters* case happened
largely without fanfare. It was as though the nation had finally grown
tired of hearing about Tennessee and its apparent affinity for "monkey
laws."

The town of Dayton, Tennessee could certainly relate to the rest of the
country's indifference. *Daniel v. Waters* was barely mentioned in the
local *Dayton Herald*. Rep. Bill Carter had sworn that the overwhelming
majority of his constituents back home in Rhea County adamantly
supported the Genesis Bill, but by 1975, as the community braced itself
for the fiftieth anniversary of the Scopes Trial, there appeared to be
little concern over the state overturning the law. Dayton might have
wanted a Genesis Bill on the books in Tennessee, but its people were no
longer willing to put up much of a fight for it. As the summer of 1975
came around, a simple commemorative postmark was one of the few
reminders of the town's controversial past. Any mail sent from Dayton
bore the "SCOPES TRIAL 50TH ANNIVERSARY, 1925-1975" stamp in the top
corner as a testament to their history.[^62]

Besides this tiny token of remembrance, relatively little else took
place in Dayton that July to celebrate fifty years of being "Monkey
Town." A theater group reenacted some of the Scopes Trial's key moments
in the famous courtroom, and local organizations set up a small bazaar
on the courthouse lawn for the townspeople to enjoy. The highlight of
the otherwise timid festivities was a college professor's recitation of
some of William Jennings Bryan's speeches on the subject of the Bible
and faith.[^63] Thus the people of Dayton sat basking in the comforting
and familiar religious imagery of Bryan's words during the summer of
1975 while the debate they had helped spark fifty years earlier, the
conflict their state had once again revived for a new generation,
continued onward, largely leaving Tennessee behind in its wake.

## Conclusion

"It is a great privilege to study both the Bible and science. It is
toward a harmony of the two that the Christian must strive." -- Russell
Artist[^64]

The 1975 defeat of his Genesis Bill marked the end of Dr. Russell
Artist's public quest for equal time in Tennessee biology classrooms.
While he still published occasional articles that discussed the merits
of Biblical creation and the fallacies of Darwinian evolution over the
course of the two decades that followed, he essentially abandoned the
thought of bringing his prized idea to life again the way he had in the
summer of 1972 with the help of Senator Milton Hamilton and his Church
of Christ brethren. The folder filled with papers he donated to David
Lipscomb College, now known as Lipscomb University, consists
predominantly of items related to the Genesis Bill. He kept virtually
everything associated with it, including his correspondences,
hand-written notes, and any article or publication he wrote or in which
he was quoted. If the small archive he left behind is any indication,
Artist certainly seemed to have been sincere when he wrote years before
that his goal in life was to help others approach science from a
Christian point of view.[^65]

But sincerity does not always ensure victory, and by all accounts
Artist's push for the Genesis Bill produced only a brief glimmer of
success before ultimately being quashed mere months before it was
scheduled to take effect during the 1975-76 school year. The creationist
movement in which Artist had been instrumental since the 1950s adjusted
itself accordingly following the loss in Tennessee, shifting their
emphasis further and further away from the Bible and closer toward a
Genesis carefully shrouded in scientific terminology. Artist's efforts
might not have won in the long run, but creationist groups like the
Creation Research Society and Henry Morris's Institute for Creation
Research paid close attention to where and how the Genesis Bill
faltered. Tennessee's "Theory and Fact Law" of 1973 thus opened the door
for all other "equal time" laws passed in the United States. Its focus
on beliefs and origin stories led to its downfall, and creationists knew
from then on not to make the same mistake again. The state that had
given the world the "Monkey Trial" changed the creation-evolution debate
not once, but twice.

While the fact that exactly fifty years transpired between Tennessee's
Butler Act and the date the Genesis Bill was set to go into effect
seemed entirely coincidental, the constant comparisons drawn between the
controversy surrounding the Genesis Bill and the Scopes Trial of 1925
were not. No other state had gone through what Tennessee had gone
through, no other state was synonymous with antievolutionism. Tennessee
experienced a perfect storm in 1973 in much the same way as it had in
1925: the combination of the right people and the right timing. If
Russell Artist had lived elsewhere, perhaps he would have tried to get a
version of the Genesis Bill passed there. It is doubtful, however, that
another state would have been quite as receptive to his ideas as the
lawmakers in Tennessee were. The Genesis Bill, like the Butler Act
before it, inadvertently served as a test for future legislation. Taking
evolution out of the realm of science and treating it instead as a
competing philosophical theory of human origins paved the way for the
further stripping of Biblical and religious concepts from scientific
creationism in the late 1970s and 1980s and eventually for "Intelligent
Design" in the 1990s and beyond. The textbook controversies and
arguments over origins that still echo through state capitol buildings
today are built upon the lessons learned from the Genesis Bill's
failure.

Dayton's lackluster fiftieth anniversary celebration of the first major
bit of "monkey business" Tennessee undertook back in 1925 symbolized
many of the changes in evolution legislation that occurred in the
decades after John Scopes was found guilty. The Scopes Trial was an
extravagant production that Dayton business boosters envisioned would
have lasting positive effects on their small East Tennessee town. What
Dayton ended up with, however, was a hazy memory of larger-than-life
celebrities, an unsympathetic media, and a nickname that would stick
with them. On the other hand, the state of Tennessee was left with an
antievolution law that stayed on the books until 1967. When Tennessee
decided to address the subject of evolution in public schools once more
almost fifty years after the Scopes Trial, the passion of the
antievolutionists was replaced by the subdued tactics of the new
creationists. The Genesis Bill passed but was quietly killed in a trial
that barely warranted mention. While a few Dayton locals strolled across
the lawn of the Rhea County courthouse during the Scopes Trial
anniversary festivities in July 1975, Dr. Russell Artist was in
Nashville still trying to come to terms with the fact that his
creationist crusade in Tennessee was over. The Scopes Trial momentarily
had resumed its storied place in the minds of Dayton and the rest of the
state as the memory of Tennessee's ill-fated Genesis Bill slowly faded
away.

[^7]: There were unsuccessful legal attempts to place strict rules on
    the teaching of evolution around the same time as the Genesis Bill
    in Colorado, Georgia, Michigan, and Washington, along with
    controversies over creationist teachings among textbook committees
    in several states, most notably Ohio and Texas. Tennessee was the
    first state to enact such a law, and subsequent bills introduced in
    other states were modeled after Tennessee's version. These attempts
    are documented in Frederic Le Clercq, "The Monkey Laws and the
    Public Schools: A Second Consumption?" *Vanderbilt Law Review* (27
    Vand. L. Rev. 209 1974). California also had a history of
    unsuccessful textbook debates over evolution dating back to 1969 and
    extending well into the 1970s. The California Board of Education
    tried to add "scientific creationism" to state biology textbooks
    alongside evolution in 1973, but their motion ultimately failed.
    Further information on the issues surrounding California's textbook
    regulations can be found in Numbers, *The Creationists*, and Edward

    doesn't recall." There is no information on where the meeting
    occurred or the exact date, simply that it took place early in 1973.
    The article was photocopied and placed in Governor Winfield Dunn's

    autobiography, *Center of the Storm: Memoirs of John T. Scopes* (New

    to speculate about the accuracy of the tales of the Robinson's Drug
    Store meeting, as the media sensationalized the account in
    newspapers published during the trial, there seems to be no reason
    to doubt that the meeting definitely took place in at least a
    somewhat similar manner to what has been reported through the years.

    Century: Homer Hailey's Personal Journey of Faith* (Tuscaloosa, AL:
    University of Alabama Press, 2000). These two books are the most
    cited works dealing with the Church of Christ. Very little has been
    written about the history of the Church of Christ compared to other
    American protestant denominations, and besides these two books, most
    studies that mention the Church of Christ discuss it in terms of the
    larger Restoration Movement and the Stone-Campbell Movement from
    which it emerged in the early nineteenth century. This is likely due
    to the disputes that have shaped these movements, causing various
    churches to spin off from others. The main three variants of these
    Restoration Movement churches are the Disciples of Christ, the
    churches of Christ/Christians, and the Church of Christ. Despite the
    similarities in their names, the three groups are distinct, and this
    paper deals only with the latter group.

[^19]: Many historians have perpetuated the misconception that
    antievolutionism and its fundamentalist champions essentially
    disappeared after the Scopes Trial, only to be revived later in a
    different format during the latter part of the twentieth century. It
    was such a popular narrative in the decades following 1925 that even
    John Scopes himself repeated the claim in his autobiography, saying
    he believed "that the Dayton trial marked the beginning of the
    decline of fundamentalism" (*Center of the Storm: Memoirs of John T.
    Scopes*, 31). Several books actively dispute this claim, however,
    proving that both antievolutionism and fundamentalism continued
    unabated after the trial, albeit in a more subdued form. For further
    discussion, see George Marsden, *Fundamentalism in American Culture*
    (New York: Oxford University Press USA, 2006); Ronald Numbers,
    *Darwinism Comes To America* (Cambridge: Harvard University Press,
    1998); and also Numbers, *The Creationists*.

[^20]: This is especially true with premillennial dispensationalism,
    which prompted its own controversy in the Church of Christ during
    the early decades of the twentieth century. Briefly, premillennial
    dispensationalism is the belief that Jesus will return to Earth
    prior to the millennium, combined with the concept of human history
    being divided into distinct "dispensations," usually seven, in which
    God sets conditions that humans must meet in order to remain in his
    favor. Premillennial dispensationalism became a defining doctrine of
    fundamentalism during the 1920s and continues to be so today. More
    information on premillennial dispensationalism and how it differs
    from other millennial outlooks, particularly postmillennialism, can
    be found in Marsden, *Fundamentalism in American Culture*. For more

    no more provable than Darwinian evolution. Second, it reintroduced

[^36]: In *The Creationists*, Ronald Numbers distinguishes between
    creationism broadly-defined and "scientific creationism," which is a
    term that he argues is more well-suited for the creationism that
    groups like the CRS promoted beginning in the 1960s. He is careful
    to point out, however, that "scientific creationism" as a concept is
    still just Biblical creationism "stripped of explicit references to
    God, Adam, and Noah." For more information, see *The Creationists*,
    as well as Numbers's earlier article, "Creationism in 20th-Century
    America" (*Science: New Series*, Vol. 218, No. 4572 [Nov. 5, 1982]).
