Welcome to the *JSR*'s new home. We have spent the past year in a series
of transitions. This time last year Mike Pasquier and Luke Harlow asked
if I would be interested in becoming editor of the journal. With little
track record for these kinds of things, their choice appeared odd, at
best. With their encouragement and blessing, I took the reins shortly
after Volume 15 was released. These parting words have rung true for me:
make sure you do whatever it takes to keep Emily Clark. With her
successful defense of her dissertation, Emily packed up her belongings
and moved to Spokane, Washington this summer to begin a tenure-track
position at Gonzaga University. In the process, I made Emily associate
editor of the journal to signify her workload and acknowledge her
talents as an editor. We were not done with changes, however. Shortly
after I assumed editorial duties, Art Remillard announced his desire to
find a replacement as book review editor. We approached Carolyn Dupont
at Eastern Kentucky University about the position, as well as podcasts,
and she agreed. With Emily's move to the West Coast, we have enlisted
the help of two graduate students at Florida State University, Adam
Brasich and Charlie McCrary, to do the important work of copy editing
for the journal. One final transition is in process as I write. Lincoln
Mullen, web editor, will step down after we have set up the new server
and launch Volume 16. In many ways, the changes coming to *JSR* over the next few years are part of Lincoln's vision for the journal. By the time you reach the end of this paragraph, Lincoln will be
on to new adventures in digital history at George Mason University.

We hope this platform allows us to carve out space between peer-reviewed
print journals and the ever-expanding world of blogs for the
interdisciplinary home of religious life in the American South. The
sixteen-year history of the journal's online presence reveals two
important aspects of *JSR*: dedicated staff and technological
innovation. There are a group of dedicated folks who understand the need
for helping scholars and non-scholars alike understand the wonderfully
complex nature of religious life in the South. While the *JSR* was not
the first online academic journal, it was part of the initial wave to
explore this new medium of online publishing. These folks are
continually trying to figure out new, innovative ways to make the
content as accessible as possible. The *JSR* has been served by
platforms from West Virginia University to Florida State University and
by volunteers willing to learn html and other coding processes. In our
efforts to bring digital content that is open to all, we make one more
transition with Volume 16 that highlights both dedication and
technological innovation. *JSR* now resides on a dynamic server with a
dedicated URL, `http://jsrelgion.org`.

The *JSR*'s mission for the past sixteen years has been to create a
place for important work on understanding the American South's many
histories and the multitude of religious experiences found within its
borders. We hope over the course of the next few years to expand how we
think about those borders in the technical sense of geography but also
in the sense of academic disciplines and how journals respond to the
waves of social media. The early advocates of this platform can rejoice
because the avenue of content delivery has come to the platform. We,
however, need to utilize the platform in ways that benefit all who come
to the site. In order to make this move, however, we needed something we
had not had: money. To begin to rectify this situation, *JSR* received a
seed grant from Mercer University's Office of the Provost to find new
ways to support the work of the journal. Under that grant, we have
purchased and migrated to the new server. The server allows us to do
several important components of online publication that we have been
unable to do. From its inception, *JSR* has functioned like a print
journal with an online format. We produced one volume per year with a
specific release date. The reasons for this fact are many, but the most
significant hurdle is the intense labor that goes into formatting files
for placement on the host server. With the new domain, we will keep all
software on the server and the site will be generated on the server
side, shortening the amount of work that is required for publication.
The importance of this point is that we can begin to publish book
reviews as they become available. In the next two years, we *intend* to
produce book reviews within one or two months of a book's publication
date. The domain and the mechanism of the review process will eventually
allow us to enter into relationships with presses to produce book
reviews within weeks, or even days, of the book's publication. The plan
is to generate revenue for *JSR* from this capacity. We will also look
to produce dynamic-content articles as the tools of digital humanities
become more widely used. The technological side of the journal is not
the only change envisioned in the coming years.

At its heart, the *JSR* strives to be an interdisciplinary journal. We
will begin to enlist a group of junior-level academics from a variety of
disciplines to serve as assistant editors. Literature serves as the most
obvious discipline where we can expand our content. The list is longer,
however, than just that one area. We would like to bring sociologists,
geographers, political scientists, and fine arts into the fold. There
are a group of scholars exploring the contours of southern religion
across the many professional conferences, which means two editors
cannot engage the journal beyond the small number of meetings we go to
in a year. Rather than wait for articles and other content to come to
us, we will be going out through the work of these assistant editors to
find that content and bring it to you. The fruits of this process are
beginning to pay off when we found an article in this issue presented as
a conference paper. In a more extensive way, work has begun on a Forum
that will appear next year that examines the religion in the American
South in the context of the greater global networks found in the
Caribbean and beyond. We hope to have the assistant editors in place
within the next year or so to expand our scope and our content.

The transitions that are underway are built on solid foundations laid
over the course of the past sixteen years. In many ways, this volume
will look no different than the previous issues. But behind the scenes
much has changed. We are dedicated to finding the best scholarship on
southern religion and placing it before your eyes. The difference moving
forward is that we can expand our digital footprint and heighten our
presence to bring more folks into contact with the good work of scholars
whose time in archives, with texts, and through interviews sheds light
on the variety of religious expressions in the American South.
