**Editor's Note**: Prior to her appointment as book review editor with
*JSR*, Carolyn Dupont had been assigned Stephen Haynes's *The Last
Segregated Hour* to review. Her own work on white Christians in
Mississippi during the Civil Rights era made her a good choice for Art
Remillard, who served as our book review editor. Since Haynes had been
slated to review Dupont's *Mississippi Praying* prior to her arrival at
the *JSR*, we have followed a different protocol for these two reviews.
The Editor handled all publication decisions regarding these reviews,
which is typically left to the book review editor's discretion.



"As a religious history of white Southern Baptists, Methodists and
Presbyterians during the civil rights era, [this book] examines
[Mississippi] evangelicals' two great enthusiasms---ardent devotion to
the Christian gospel and equal zeal for what can only be described as
white supremacy---and explains how these commitments interacted with one
another" (2). So begins Carolyn Dupont's *Mississippi Praying*. As
Dupont points out, her approach is unusual inasmuch as it takes with
utmost seriousness the "relationship between white supremacy and white
religion," a theme that is featured "only incidentally...if at all" in
the historiography of massive white resistance (3). Under implicit
attack in this approach are the views that white religion "passed the
civil rights years as a silent, passive or unimportant player" and that
white evangelicals' support for segregation was limited to "preaching
the biblical case for it" (4, 6).

Generally speaking, Dupont discredits the notion that white responses to
the civil rights movement can be explained in terms of "cultural
captivity" (as an earlier generation of scholars of southern religion
maintained), and notes that this perspective obscures the ways white
religion created and sustained the South's system of oppression. Dupont
shows that although Mississippi evangelicals vehemently defended their
apolitical character and condemned coreligionists who confused the goal
of social change with the gospel mission of changing "one heart at a
time," evangelical doctrine concealed a specific political orientation
concerned with deciding and justifying which Mississippians would "have
access to its resources, power and privilege" (8).

Throughout *Mississippi Praying*, Dupont suggests that faith's largest
service to white supremacy may have been the individualistic ethos it
embraced and embodied "so expertly that collective actions seemed to
disappear" (17). This ethos allowed white Mississippians to interpret
blacks' inferior education, poverty, low political participation and
high incarceration levels as "the inevitable expressions of black
inferiority rather than as props for the parts whites forced them to
play" (27). Mississippi's white Christians did not eschew moral
concerns, of course, but "their careful structuring of these concerns
kept segregation from appearing in any catalogue of sins" (35).

In a chapter titled "Responding to Brown," Dupont tells the stories of
how Mississippi's major Protestant denominations---the Southern Baptist
Convention, the United Methodist Church and the Presbyterian Church in
the United States---each endorsed the *Brown* decision in the months
after it was handed down. As a result, many white Mississippians were
forced to conclude that national religious institutions could be "as
menacing to the Southern way of life as the Supreme Court." Accordingly,
Mississippi churches quickly joined the opposition to integration (65).
Resistance strategies of choice included cries for local autonomy
(which, Dupont points out, bore a strong resistance to the political
principle of "interposition"), condemnations of ecclesiastical judgments
on matters "purely civic," critiques of top-down decision-making, and
warnings of denominational schism. Assertions that segregation was
"time-tested and proven" were oft-heard, as were claims that segregation
was not discriminatory, that blacks "preferred their own churches," and
that segregation was for the good of both races. Not surprisingly, the
specter of interracial marriage and miscegenation lurked just below the
surface of these arguments.

Resistance to integration in post-*Brown* Mississippi, Dupont observes,
was characterized by a "holy symbiosis" between white evangelicalism and
black subjugation (16). Thus, when grass-roots organizations such as the
Mississippi Association of Methodist Ministers and Laymen (MAMML) sprung
up to protect local prerogatives and protest the "integration
propaganda" (132) flowing from denominational agencies, their leadership
inevitably overlapped with that of Mississippi's Citizens' Councils;
similarly, when a leading Presbyterian divine offered a forceful defense
of racial separation in late 1954, it was published by the Citizens'
Council as "A Christian View of Segregation."

Naturally, a signal Christian contribution to massive resistance
involved making a biblical/theological case for segregation. "Because
religion now jeopardized segregation," Dupont writes, "segregationists
called on religion to defend it" (80). The result was a proliferating
"segregationist folk theology" that was typically articulated by
"layfolk and ministers without denominational connections" (81). Dupont
cites a number of examples, particularly from the 1950s, of Christian
spokesmen who developed biblical apologies for segregation in
Mississippi; but generally, she writes, segregationist folk theology
"announced itself in the ordinary operations of life; it wove itself
into workday exchanges, peppered private ruminations, and bubbled up in
conversations" (86). This conclusion is based on her study of a variety
of church documents, newspaper articles, diary entries and private
correspondence.

In the second half of *Mississippi Praying* Dupont details the growing
tensions between Mississippi Baptists, Methodists, and Presbyterians and
their co-religionists in other parts of the country, tensions that were
exacerbated by the pro-civil rights stances taken by denominational
agencies such as the SBC's Christian Life Commission. White Mississippi
Baptists, not wanting to appear unconcerned with the welfare of African
Americans in the state, tended to favor the SBC's Department of Negro
Work, which supported the separate training of black ministers while
"operat[ing] firmly within the accepted practices and structures of
segregation" (122). Baptist pulpits were other sites of opposition to
denominational trends. Pastors like Douglas Hudgins of First Baptist,
Jackson ("the very epicenter of Baptist life in Mississippi," where Ross
Barnett and other leaders of mass resistance worshipped), is profiled as
an exemplar of the sort of tall-steeple preacher who rarely preached
about race, but whose relentless emphasis on individualistic
spirituality made him an effective advocate for "the old ways." Though
he claimed to eschew politics in the pulpit, Hudgins "made abundantly
clear his sympathy with political ideologies that elevated the efforts
and rights of individuals" and cast government as a "morally corrupting
force on otherwise hard-working individuals" (117). According to Dupont,
Hudgins' preaching "remade African Americans' legitimate appeals for
federal protections as encouragement for their own degeneracy. More
subtly but more powerfully than a sermon on the curse of Ham, Hudgins'
explication of Christian America offered blacks no effective path for
ending the oppression they suffered" (119).

Dupont illumines "the travail of Mississippi Methodism" with reference
to the controversy over the "Born of Conviction" statement signed in
January 1963 by twenty-eight young ministers who were native
Mississippians. The statement affirmed support for the official
anti-segregation stance of the Methodist Church and claimed that Christ
"permits no discrimination because of race, color, or creed" (127).
Moderate Mississippi Methodists like the signers of "Born of Conviction"
were characterized by "institutional loyalty and theological
flexibility" that put them in dangerous opposition to the majority of
their co-religionists in the state. The fallout pushed seventeen of the
twenty-eight signers from their churches within six months; within a
year, eighteen had left the state. As Dupont concludes, the firestorm
over "Born of Conviction" is emblematic of the way Mississippi
Methodists, particularly after the Meredith crisis of 1962, "passed the
civil rights years in chronic, debilitating turmoil" (128).

In her chapter on "The Jackson Church Visits," Dupont describes how
beginning in June, 1963 activists from across the nation "took the
movement to the church doors" of the Mississippi capitol (156). Others
have told the story of church kneel-ins in Mississippi (and across the
South). What Dupont adds is compelling evidence that "nowhere did
activists assault sanctuary doors as relentlessly nor endure rejection
as consistently, as in Jackson" (165). She stresses that these
"kneel-ins" brought competing visions of the Christian faith into stark,
dramatic contrast: on one hand, "a southern Christianity, in which a
commitment to the racial hierarchy occupied a central place," on the
other "an emerging American version, in which an embrace of human
quality was rapidly becoming a given" (165). Ending in April 1964, the
Jackson kneel-ins presented an "ironic interpretive backdrop" for the
"orgy of violence against people and property" that ensued in the summer
of that year (172).

In a chapter titled "Race and the Restructuring of American Religion,"
Dupont demonstrates the relevance of her study of Mississippi in 1950s
and 60s for understanding white southern Protestantism in subsequent
decades. With a variety of examples, she shows that after 1968 "the
advocates of segregation often morphed into champions of a restrictive
emphasis on literal biblical interpretation, as contests over theology
and denominational identity moved to center stage in every religious
communion" (200). Dupont argues, for example, that understanding the
Conservative Resurgence within the Southern Baptist Convention requires
recognition of the fact that the champions of biblical inerrancy were
fighting in part to preserve a denomination "committed to
individualistic notions of social change through personal salvation"
(202), notions that had come under attack during the heyday of the civil
rights movement. Over time, the connection between the civil rights
struggle and the struggle for the soul of the SBC became less visible as
the ostensible issues turned from segregation and poverty to biblical
inerrancy. But, Dupont contends, the connection is there.

Presbyterians in Mississippi provide another example of the way debates
over civil rights became sublimated after the 1960s in disputes over the
spread of "liberalism." It is not coincidental, Dupont notes, that the
conservative Presbyterian Church in America (PCA), founded in 1973 from
disaffected PCUS congregations, began with more churches from
Mississippi than any other state. As with Baptists, Presbyterians framed
their dissent from the PCUS in theological terms, but it is not
difficult to discern the PCA's "rigid commitments to the theological
ideals that had served the racial hierarchy" (214). Dupont notes, in
fact, how some of the PCA's founding fathers "contributed eagerly and
meaningfully to the fight against black equality" (217). The link
between race and theological conservatism is also evident in the fact
that the PCA very intentionally reached back to the antebellum period to
retrieve an emphasis on "the spirituality of the church," a concept
originally fashioned to keep ecclesiastical entities from passing
judgment on civil arrangements (such as chattel slavery). In their quest
to return to the spiritual origins of Southern Presbyterianism, Dupont
concludes, "those who struggled to preserve their superiority over
slavery's descendants clung tightly to precisely this doctrine, praising
their slaveholding forefathers as the devoted champions of a pure and
uncorrupted faith" (220).

Among Dupont's conclusions, one for which her book provides a great deal
of evidence, is that in civil rights-era Mississippi "moral
suasion...proved largely fruitless" (231)--that it was only after laws
and customs were altered that whites' racial views began to change. This
points means that the regeneration of souls is the only hope for the
world, which is still voiced by conservative Protestants in Mississippi
and elsewhere, does not bring about positive change. Dupont notes that
such individualistic views of sin, morality and responsibility structure
thinking in ways that "obscure and discount collective and corporate
responsibility" (232). Thus the irony that although Mississippi
evangelicals in the post-civil rights era have added "racism" to their
standard catalogue of sins, they continue to cling to the very
individualist theology "that sustained the racial hierarchy and informed
the defense of segregation" (229).

*Mississippi Praying* is a powerful and important book; it is thoroughly
researched, carefully argued and beautifully written. It sheds
considerable light on the response of white Protestants in Mississippi
to the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, and it dares to
draw connections between those responses and the positions taken by
conservative Christians in the state in the years since the 1960s. Many
of these people continue to tell themselves and others that their
dissent from more socially conscious elements of their denominations
"wasn't about race"; *Mississippi Praying* shows that the matter is not
that simple.
