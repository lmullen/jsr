Nineteenth-century American Christians shared a faith in the providence
of God over human affairs. Many also believed that the millennium, the
thousand year era of peace prophesized in the Revelation, fast
approached, and that the United States would play a vital role in this
eschatological drama. Secular life thus became infused with sacred
meaning, and many Americans sought to divine the will of God in the
course of contemporary events. But despite their shared religious
assumptions, Christians found disparate religious implications in the
Civil War and Reconstruction. Ben Wright and Zachary Dresser’s edited
volume, *Apocalypse and the Millennium in the American Civil War Era*,
traces the diverse expressions of millennialism among Americans in the
middle decades of nineteenth century. Cumulatively, the volume argues
that millennialism shaped Americans’ understanding of war, emancipation,
and Reconstruction, while at the same time transforming those
providential beliefs.

Jason Phillips examines proslavery secessionist Edmund Ruffin’s
prophetic novel, *Anticipations of the Future* (1860), which pushed
white southerners toward secession by predicting southern victory in a
future civil war. Stressing an implicit theme of the volume, Phillips
argues that historians should embrace prophecy as an analytical category
comparable to memory because it shapes action in the present while
helping people envision and achieve a different future. Moreover, the
study of prophecy helps lay bare the culture that gives rise to such
prophecies. Thus, Ruffin’s prophetic novel, Phillips argues, embodied
the secessionist’s enlightenment and rationalist sensibility as well as
his pro-active disposition. Prophetic thinking also shaped the output of
novelist James Fenimore Cooper, according to Ryan Cordell. Cooper’s
novel *The Crater* (1847), much like Ruffin’s later novel, reflected
contemporary concerns. Cooper and other northern evangelicals worried
that the sectarianism of the 1830s and 1840s—especially the sectional
split of the Baptist and Methodist churches—exacerbated many of the
nation’s moral ills, including slavery, and would ultimately lead to an
apocalypse.

Other essays explore the influence of prophetic thinking in New England,
Canada, South Carolina, and the Far West. Robert K. Nelson examines how
the growth of spiritualism transformed the millennial expectations of
some radical abolitionists. These activists looked askance at
spiritualists’ claims of promoting a national moral revolution, leading
them to “temper their perfectionism and millennialism” and embrace a
pragmatic political program (33). Farther south, the biracial Associate
Reformed Presbyterian Church in upcountry South Carolina, according to
Joseph Moore, espoused colonization to achieve the redemption of Africa
and the gradual end of slavery. These southerners’ millennialism, Moore
argues, led them to embrace an alternative to sectional conflict, though
their efforts failed before South Carolina’s proslavery consensus. In
the Far West, according to Jennifer Graber, American missionaries
interpreted the mass Dakota conversions after 1862’s Dakota War as
evidence of the power of “redemptive violence” (111). Such
interpretations, however, ignored the motives and traditional beliefs of
the Dakota who, according to Graber, sought an alliance with a powerful
Christian god to ensure their survival. In Canada West (present-day
Ontario), a different form of millenarian nationalism prevailed,
according to Nina Reid Maroney, based on the Church of England’s
identity as the national church of a redeemer nation. The Mission to the
Fugitives Slaves in Canada (MFSC), Anglican leaders believed, would
forward the millennial goal of ending slavery in the United States. But
the reality of life in Canada West—harsh conditions and racial
prejudice—and slavery’s end in the United States tempered ministers’
millennial expectations.

The next four essays explore the impact of the Civil War and
Reconstruction on American millennialism. Co-editor Zachary W. Dresser
argues that most white Americans neither abandoned their religious
beliefs nor simply reaffirmed them, but instead altered their faith in
order make traditional notions fit a dramatically changed world.
Focusing on Old School Presbyterian theologians Robert Lewis Dabney and
Benjamin Morgan Palmer, Dresser documents the way both men reworked
their theological notions to retain the core of their faith. Matthew
Harper’s examination of African American millennialism in post-Civil War
Wilmington, North Carolina, argues that freed people understood
emancipation as part of God’s plan and the fulfillment of black
prophecy, prompting a sharp rise in black conversions and the creation
of independent black churches. The memory of emancipation also provided
hope during the dark years that followed the collapse of Reconstruction.
Scott Nesbit’s study of black leaders’ post-Civil War debate over land
in Lowcountry South Carolina reflected differences on how best to attain
a providential future. Hardliners argued that the new moral order
required foreclosing on indebted slaveholders to punish them and
dismantle the old economy, while more moderate black leaders believed
extending Christian charity toward the planters would bring concord.
When whites responded with violence in the late 1860s and early 1870s,
many Lowcountry African Americans concluded that only through migration,
including for some exodus to Liberia, could they achieve their
providential goals. Finally, Charles Irons explores how African
Americans’ desire at war’s end to forge a biracial “beloved community”
(210) and redeem the South helped shape their decisions to remain within
white churches or create independent black churches. Irons argues that
historians must focus on local conditions to understand why, in the
immediate aftermath of the war, some African Americans concluded they
could achieve their millennial ends through the “radical” step of
building independent churches, while others embraced “accommodationist”
(209) approaches.

The volume helpfully concludes with Edward Blum’s overview of the
changes war and Reconstruction brought to American Christianity—and
specifically to millennial thought. American believers, Blum notes,
suffered a loss of certainty and authority, in large part because of
their conflicting millennial claims. In response, they often sought to
incorporate greater flexibility and ambiguity into their religious
assumptions. This recasting of Christianity manifested itself most
notably in the shift away from pronouncements about the literal return
of Christ to a focus on “what he would think and how he would be
treated,” were he to return (246). Blum proves less successful in
showing how millennialism shaped emancipation and Reconstruction, but
his essay helps tie together what at times seems a disparate collection
of localized studies. Certainly, the essays in this volume demonstrate
the diverse manifestations of American millennialism, but that very
multiplicity raises questions about the practicality of eschatological
thought as a category of historical analysis. Ultimately, these essays
demonstrate—as contributor Charles Irons stresses—how local conditions
rather than shared providential beliefs helped shape Americans’
understanding of the millennial significance of the Civil War and its
aftermath.
