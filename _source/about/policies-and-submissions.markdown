## Overview

The *Journal of Southern Religion* is a fully peer-reviewed academic
journal reflecting the best traditions of objective and critical
scholarship in the study of religion. As an interdisciplinary venture,
the editors invite submissions from historians, religionists,
anthropologists, sociologists, and other interested scholars. The
journal welcomes submissions on all aspects of southern religion but is
especially interested in publishing manuscripts that address the
following topics:

-   Regionalism in southern religion, e.g., Appalachia, the Gulf Coast,
    south Florida and the Caribbean
-   religious aspects of southern culture, e.g., religion and cuisine,
    music, and southern literature
-   southern civil religion
-   local and folk religions, including ethnographic studies of
    congregations and parishes
-   ethnicity including immigration and slave religions
-   religion and race, class, disability, and gender issues in the
    South.

Scholars desiring to submit their research to the journal should read the
submissions policy.

Unsolicited manuscripts should fit broadly into one or more of the
categories outlined by the journal's editorial policies. Materials
submitted to *JSR* must not have been previously published nor submitted
for publication elsewhere while under review by *JSR* editors. 

All submissions should be accompanied by the author's name, current
institutional affiliation, postal and e-mail addresses. Paper
manuscripts will not be returned. In most cases, authors will be
notified within ninety days whether or not their submission has been
accepted. 

Electronic publication allows for the addition of images and other
visual or auditory aids, and the editors encourage authors to include
such with articles when appropriate. Authors should make certain that
all submitted materials are clear of copyright claims or that they
obtain permission as required by law. *JSR* reserves copyright
privileges for all materials published.

### Accepted Manuscripts

Acceptance: If a submission is accepted, the author will sign a contract
with *JSR* assigning copyright to the *Journal of Southern Religion*.
After making corrections and revisions, the author should submit the
accepted manuscript via email to the editors as a Microsoft Word file
(.doc or .docx) or as valid HTML. Please include at the top of the first
page of the manuscript, the title, your name, your current academic rank
(or equivalent), and your institutional affiliation. The revised
manuscript will be copyedited and uploaded to the *JSR* site for the
succeeding annual issue, usually published in the fall. At the present
time, *JSR* does not provide authors with offprints of published
materials, but we will notify you by email when your manuscript is
published online.

Solicited essays should conform to the same criteria but are not
restricted by word length requirements.


### JSR Style

All manuscripts should follow the *Chicago Manual of Style*.

## Book Review Guidelines

Thank you for agreeing to review a book for the *Journal of Southern
Religion*. Reviews are a vital part of the journal. At their best, as
historian Steven Stowe has observed, reviews are a "vernacular form of
scholarly talk" that assess where we are, where we are going, and how we
might best reshape our work.

Book reviews should be between 500 and 1,000 words, but we have no
formal limit. Scholars interested in submitting book reviews to JSR
should contact the book review editor Art Remillard.

-	Art Remillard, [aremillard@francis.edu](mailto:aremillard@francis.edu)

When you receive your review copy, please send a short confirmation
message to the book review editor. Within eight weeks, please email your
review for approval and editing. 

Book reviewers should consult the book review style sheet before
submitting reviews. Please refer to the guidelines below as you write.

*JSR* seeks reviews that:

1.  Tell plainly what the book says and for whom it is written. Most
	readers read reviews to learn the scope and argument of a book. In
	addition, a careful assessment of the book's intended audience is of
	particular interest to the readers of an interdisciplinary journal
	such as the *JSR*.

2.  Set the author's argument in a broad context of scholarly analysis.
	Reviewers should bear in mind that scholars from a variety of
	disciplines will read the review. The perspectives of the reviewer's
	own discipline will be of great interest, but reviewers should avoid
	assessments based solely on issues of interest to those in a single
	field or subfield.

3.  Suggest whether the author achieves the book's stated purpose and
    assesses the significance of that goal. Criticism is welcomed, of
    course, but it should be made only on courteous and constructive
    terms. The editors will either ask reviewers to rewrite sections
    that breach this standard or refuse the submission altogether.

Writing should be concise yet lively, and should strive to balance a
personal voice with careful analysis.

### Book Review Style and Format

Most reviews run between 500 and 1,000 words, but there is no formal
limit.

All reviews should be submitted as an e-mail attachment in Word format
to the book review editor.

The following information should appear at the top of the review:

> Author. *Full Title of the Book*. Place of Publishing: Publisher, Date
> of Publication. Number of Pages. ISBN. Reviewed by Name of Author.

Please list your name, current status, department, and affiliation at the end of the review; such as: Arthur Remillard is an associate professor of Religious Studies at Saint Francis University.

Reviewers should consult the *Chicago Manual of Style* on all questions
of style. Please supply page numbers for all quoted passages. Use the
first name in the initial reference to any person (including the
author). With organizations or acts, use the full name in the initial
reference; all subsequent references may use initials or acronyms.
Please supply publication dates of any books mentioned in the review.

Please proofread the text of the review carefully.

Questions should be directed to the book review editor. 

### Status of Electronic Reviews

Professional ethics dictate that a scholar can publish only one review
of a book. *Journal of Southern Religion* reviews count as that one
review. As indicated above, Journal reviewers have permission to
republish their reviews provided that proper credit is given to the
*Journal of Southern Religion*, but should not agree to write a separate
review of the same work for a print journal.
