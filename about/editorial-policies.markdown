*The Journal of Southern Religion* is a fully peer-reviewed academic
journal reflecting the best traditions of objective and critical
scholarship in the study of religion. As an interdisciplinary venture,
the editors invite submissions from historians, religionists,
anthropologists, sociologists, and other interested scholars. The
journal welcomes submissions on all aspects of Southern Religion but is
especially interested in publishing manuscripts that address the
following topics: 1) Regionalism in Southern Religion, e.g., Appalachia,
the Gulf Coast, South Florida and the Caribbean; 2) religious aspects of
Southern culture, e.g., Religion and cuisine, music, and Southern
literature; 3) Southern civil religion; 4) local and folk religions,
including ethnographic studies of congregations and parishes; 5)
ethnicity including immigration and slave religions; 6) religion and
race, class, disability, and gender issues in the South. Individuals
desiring to submit their research to JSR should read the [submissions
