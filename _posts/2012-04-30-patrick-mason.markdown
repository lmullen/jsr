In this podcast, [Art Remillard][] talks with [Patrick Mason][] about
his new book, [*The Mormon Menace: Violence and Anti-Mormonism in the
Postbellum South*][]. Mason is the Howard W. Hunter Chair of Mormon Studies at
Claremont Graduate University. During this conversation, Mason explains
what initially drew him to this unique project, which represents a
significant contribution to both southern religious history and Mormon
history. He offers insights into how he conceptualized violence to frame
his narrative, and how anti-Mormonism differed from the prejudices faced
by Jews and Catholics. Mason also looks ahead, discussing future
projects and sharing his thoughts on what Mitt Romney’s candidacy might
mean for Mormons in the South and nationally.

\[Mason's book was [reviewed in volume 13] of the *JSR*.\]
