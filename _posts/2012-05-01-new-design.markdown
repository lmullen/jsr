The *Journal of Southern Religion* has released a new version of its
website today. This update includes a new design, which we hope will
make the journal more usable and readable. We've added some useful
features, such as [COinS embedded metadata][] for each article, so that
you can automatically import citation information into tools like
[Zotero][], and footnotes that display citations without requiring you
to scroll to the bottom of this page. (Click this footnote link for a
demo.[^1])

The *JSR* has been an open-access journal from the beginning, but now it
is open-source journal as well. You can see the [source code that
generates this site at GitHub][]. You're welcome to play around with the
code and offer fixes.

The new site also includes some additional content. The [*JSR
Podcast*][] has now released two episodes, the [first an interview with
Paul Harvey][] and the second an [interview with Patrick Mason][]. The
site also has space for a [blog][].

Work on the new site is ongoing. In particular, we are gradually moving
our back issues into the new site. Please feel free to offer suggestions
in the comments, by [e-mail][], or on [GitHub][source code that
generates this site at GitHub]. 

We hope you enjoy the new *JSR*.
